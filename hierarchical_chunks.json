Every plant carries seeds, and when you water it, it grows—and eventually those seeds turn into more plants. In the same way, when you react to a negative thought, you give it energy. That reaction leads to more negative thoughts, and those give rise to even more. So what's the solution? Stop watering the plants you don’t want growing. Let the negative thoughts pass without feeding them with attention. Over time, they lose their power. I’ve been practicing this for the past 6 months, and life feels noticeably lighter. There's more space, more peace. If you’re feeling stuck in your head or weighed down by thoughts, I’d be happy to share more or just talk it through.\n\nAuthor: Organic_Bite1569\nScore: 944\nComments: 17\n\nTop Community Responses:\n\n[Comment 1] jfdonohoe (Score: 36): Two things that helped me was: - for a long time realizing that if I needed to recall something in my past to make me feel cringe then I must be doing pretty good today - more recently I’ve grown into realizing that my brain’s habit of reaching for painful thoughts is a malformed defense mechanism.

I remember I fumbled and dropped a pair of tongs in a gas station while trying to use it to grab my food. Caught food, got icing on fingers, tongs clattered to the floor. I turned bright red, and everyone was staring. I turned to my family and started laughing. My dad poked fun and said, \"You're turning really red,\" which made it worse. I couldn't help but grin even more. (I just gave the tongs back so the woman behind the desk could get a fresh pair. I even made the cashier smile). Either you laugh in the moment and make a good memory out of it, or you say, \"Oh well,\" happens to the best of us. It's not a big deal. We're only human. Sometimes humans behave funny, and that's OK. The best part is, sometimes when you laugh and smile, it's infectious.\n\n[Comment 6] ElderberryOne1171 (Score: 8): When I divert my attention it feels like I’m suppressing the thought though?\n\n[Comment 7] Zestyclose_Mode_2642 (Score: 6): There's redirecting attention through tension and willpower, and there's relaxing and allowing the object of meditation to move a bit more to the foreground again. The first is a clumsy strategy because it causes a lot of tension, the second one is what you want to cultivate. Alternatively you can just get really curious about the flow of the mind and eventually it will let itself go, and you relax into that.\n\n[Comment 8] LotusHeals (Score: 5): There are things fed to you through various mediums. By choosing to believe in them, you create mental limits. For example, \"we are biologically programmed to focus on negative events, thoughts, feelings\". How do you know this is true? Just because science says so? Instead, I encourage you to forget this knowledge (because it's learnt from external sources, not from your experience) and always believe your own direct experience. Thoughts come and go. Their nature is temporary. By mindfulness training and what OP did, one can stop letting thoughts dictate one's life, mood, state of being. But if one believes in learnt knowledge like \"we associate them with danger and our survivalist brain kicks in\", your mind internalises this info and runs accordingly. It's harder to be at peace when the mind is ruled by such knowledge, which limits its potential.\n",

I decided to give dopamine reset a shot. not perfect but better than anything else i have tried so far. here is what worked for me: 30-Day Detox: Cut my screen time in half over two weeks. Didn’t go cold turkey but set strict limits for social media and distractions. Redirect Habits: Replaced phone time with taking a walk outside. This was tough at first but effective. Strict App Blocking: Made mornings and evenings completely avoiding my phone. This cleared my mind than i had thought.

What happens is that we lay down to go to sleep, and it's the first time our brains have been allowed to wander all day, and then you have the \"I can't fall asleep because my brain won't shut up!\" Well, of course it won't, you haven't let it talk all day!

On a very hot day, they spotted a lake and stopped by, besieged by thirst. Buddha asked his younger disciple, famous for his impatient nature: – I’m thirsty. Can you bring me some water from that lake? The disciple went to the lake but when he arrived, he saw that just at that moment, a bullock cart was going through it. As a result, the water became very muddy. The disciple thought: “I can’t give my teacher this muddy water to drink.” So he came back and told Buddha: – The water in the lake is very muddy. I don’t think we can drink it. After half an hour, Buddha asked the same disciple to return to the lake and bring him some water to drink. The disciple returned to the lake. However, to his dismay, he discovered that the water was still dirty. He returned and told Buddha, this time with a conclusive tone: – The water of that lake can’t be drunk, we’d better walk to the village so the villagers can give us some water. Buddha did not answer him, but he did not move either. After a while, he asked the disciple himself to return to the lake and bring him water. The disciple went to the lake because he did not want to challenge his master, but he was furious that he sent him back and forth to the lake, when he already knew that the muddy water could not be drunk. However, when he arrived this time, the water was crystal clear. So he picked up some of it and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the water, and then said to his disciple: – What did you do to clean the water? The disciple did not understand the question, it was evident that he didn’t do anything. Then Buddha explained to him: – Wait and let her be. So the mud settles on its own, and you have clean water. Your mind is like that too! When it is disturbed, you just have to let it be. Give it some time. Do not be impatient. It will find the balance by itself. You do not have to make any effort to calm it down.

I kept thinking if I just got it all right, the job, the timing, the rhythm, I’d land in some lasting state of joy. But happiness didn’t stay. Neither did sadness. Both came and went like passing weather. Eventually, I noticed something quieter underneath it all. Peace. It wasn’t exciting. It didn’t fix everything. But it stayed. Some small things helped me get there: • Breathing through discomfort instead of avoiding it • Doing simple things slowly — walking, eating, even folding laundry • Letting go of the idea that life should always feel good • Reminding myself: everything changes, and that’s okay Happiness and sadness visit. Peace is learning not to chase either. I’m curious, what’s helped you find that space between the highs and lows?\n\nAuthor: WalknReflect\nScore: 354\nComments: 32\n\nTop Community Responses:\n\n[Comment 1] ASTAARAY (Score: 14): There’s something revolutionary about being okay with okay.\n\n[Comment 2] Neat_Exit3491 (Score: 14): There is a reason that Buddhism is called the middle way.\n\n[Comment 3] NellyNeesh (Score: 12): Whenever I catch myself dreading something, I try reaffirm that feeling. For example if I know I have a busy day at work, I tell myself before work “today’s gonna be rough.” , but when I do that I find that it’s never as bad as I was envisioning, and when something is better than you were expecting it feels easier to appreciate it and experience peace. I think the immediate reaction to a bad thought is to deny it and tell yourself “ it’s okay it’s going to be alright” but that’s almost a lie to yourself, try to accept the bad thought and just see what happens.\n\n[Comment 4] DesignByNY (Score: 11): Thich Naht Hanh said: “There is no way to happiness; happiness is the way.” That landed hard for me and and changed my perception.

When I stopped chasing happiness, I realized that it might never be a constant state, but rather moments of relief within the complexity of my own being. I learned to listen to what was behind the emotions, unspoken desires, old fears, and voices that weren't mine but that I carried. Noticing peace began with this: stopping the self-judgment and starting to listen to myself with honesty. And in that space, peace stopped being a destination... and became a possible place within me.\n\n[Comment 6] WalknReflect (Score: 8): Totally get that. I’ve felt that way too, like if I’m not chasing something, I’m just stuck with what’s wrong. But sometimes the shift isn’t about settling, it’s about seeing that even in a messy life, small moments still carry meaning. A quiet morning, a deep breath, someone checking in, those things aren’t flashy, but they add up. Walking or hiking in nature can make you appreciate those moments a lot more I find.\n\n[Comment 7] CampingGeek2002 (Score: 8): Op same here.

And when I get tired and worn out from the misery, I see I forgot what keeps me here, what makes life worthwhile, and that's my love for my loved ones, wanting the best for them. Not to give them things. To be the best me I can be for them and to teach them resilience, to be a splendid person. When I remember that, I am at peace.

Running mental simulations. Replaying conversations. Planning for problems that hadn’t happened yet. It felt like I was being productive. But really, I was just exhausting myself. Lately, I’ve been doing something different. Nothing dramatic. Just… pausing. Noticing my breath. Feeling the tension instead of fixing it. Letting myself be in the moment, even if it’s messy or unfinished. It’s subtle, but something shifted. The world didn’t change — I just don’t feel like I have to grip it so tightly anymore.

I remember I fumbled and dropped a pair of tongs in a gas station while trying to use it to grab my food. Caught food, got icing on fingers, tongs clattered to the floor. I turned bright red, and everyone was staring. I turned to my family and started laughing. My dad poked fun and said, \"You're turning really red,\" which made it worse. I couldn't help but grin even more. (I just gave the tongs back so the woman behind the desk could get a fresh pair. I even made the cashier smile). Either you laugh in the moment and make a good memory out of it, or you say, \"Oh well,\" happens to the best of us. It's not a big deal. We're only human. Sometimes humans behave funny, and that's OK. The best part is, sometimes when you laugh and smile, it's infectious.\n\nAuthor: Worried-Bear4099\nScore: 10",

By choosing to believe in them, you create mental limits. For example, \"we are biologically programmed to focus on negative events, thoughts, feelings\". How do you know this is true? Just because science says so? Instead, I encourage you to forget this knowledge (because it's learnt from external sources, not from your experience) and always believe your own direct experience. Thoughts come and go. Their nature is temporary. By mindfulness training and what OP did, one can stop letting thoughts dictate one's life, mood, state of being. But if one believes in learnt knowledge like \"we associate them with danger and our survivalist brain kicks in\", your mind internalises this info and runs accordingly. It's harder to be at peace when the mind is ruled by such knowledge, which limits its potential.\n\nAuthor: LotusHeals\nScore: 5",

He keeps bringing it up, and you listen, but you don't emotionally engage with the story.

To me \"letting go\" sort of feels like those thoughts should disappear. But the reality is that they won't dissappear nor is it necessary for them to dissappear in order for you to heal or be happy. Those thoughts can be there, you just need ro realize and feel they can't hurt you. Accepting, truly accepting that they are just there will over time make there impact weaker and weaker. And after a while those thoughts will show up less and less. But when they do, they won't be able to upset you. Because you accept them.\n\nAuthor: Think004\nScore: 3",

Then: Be perfectly still. Do not move a muscle as you continue to spontaneously breathe. Allow it to be, just as it is. Allow yourself to be, just as you are. Be perfectly still. Witness all of the sensations arising in your physical body, and continue to breathe. Let it all be just as it is. Be perfectly still. With each breath, let go of more and more subtle tension with the exhale. Feel a deep sense of expansion with the inhalation. Be perfectly still. Let it all be. Remain like this for some time. Be perfectly still. Observe all the arises, unfolds, and passes away in the light of your neutral awareness. And continue to breathe. Let it all be, just as it is. When you're ready, do something else.\n\nAuthor: somanyquestions32\nScore: 2",

Let them diagnose you, and consider their recommendations for treatment. Don’t be afraid to seek help from others, we are social creatures and should lean on others in times of crisis. Rumination, like in your case, can be easily undone in the matter of a week with the proper treatment. It will allow you to conquer your thoughts, and to move on. And this is 2025, not 1925. Don’t feel as though you have to “deal with it” alone, or that it’ll go away by itself. Your mental health is incredibly important, because at the end of the day, your mind is how you see the world (and yourself). You can try meditating as well. Before you fall to sleep, relax your whole body, and imagine putting all your worries into a box. Lock up that box, keep it closed, and feel the peace of just being you. And it is in that moment when you are truly in the present, not depressed about the past or anxious about the future. You will suddenly realize that you are not your thoughts :)\n\nAuthor: synoveran\nScore: 1",

Because I can’t recall when I walked without my AirPods on.\n\nComment: This is random but your comment just reminded me of this... I listened to a podcast over a decade ago that I cannot stop thinking about. It was talking about sleep, and it got to talking about how our brains are built to wander, they are meant to be bored. When we have quiet, down time our brains will process through thoughts and kinda work through everything weighing on the mind. In today's day and age, we are always actively doing something: talking to people at work, looking at screen, listening to music in car, probably have earbuds in with a podcast or music when walking, driving, or doing chores. What happens is that we lay down to go to sleep, and it's the first time our brains have been allowed to wander all day, and then you have the \"I can't fall asleep because my brain won't shut up!\" Well, of course it won't, you haven't let it talk all day! So, anyway, all that to say... sometimes going on the walk just to listen to the birds or other ambient noises, and letting your brain wander, can still be helpful.\n\nAuthor: goyangicatgato\nScore: 39",

It’s like reading things on the internet, but in audio form. We have every resource in the world to keep ourselves occupied 24/7 and never experience solitude.

I'm a teacher so over the summers I get bored easily. Last summer I filled a lot of my time with tiktoks and THC. I found myself to be very irritable at the end of the day and disinterested in things that I knew I would enjoy. I'm thinking it was because I had drained all my dopamine with short form videos and THC combined. I cut back significantly on THC and deleted Tiktok off my phone. I feel much better. Next step is to get rid of Reels as well since Im sure theyre just as harmful.\n\nAuthor: Successful_Mall3070\nScore: 10",

Ever since my early 20s I pursue pleasure all the time, things that make me feel good, I eat fast food almost daily, been addicted to all kinds of sedative pills (self medicating), screens (phone scrolling/laptop) for hours and hours..etc I can’t stand boredom it literally terrifies me. Now I’m in my 30s and I’m not satisfied with my life at all even though my circumstances are not bad at all. I’m healthy, I live with my supportive kind family, I got a decent job etc, but something inside me is not right. I know it has to do with this dopamine thing but I can’t bring myself to start a detox or something. I can’t see the meaning in making my life “right”…. then what!?!?\n\nAuthor: Amaal_hud\nScore: 7",

I have also trained my brain to defocus my eyes and block anything that is triggering - really helps. What I am finding more and more are groups forming their own social platforms based on hobbies and activities. I also like that the folks running these are passionate and invested in growing the community. They are typically free, but have a pay plan that provide additional content. I subscribe because I not only want these groups to succeed, but I find the additional content well done. I find folks on these type of groups - shared passions, activities, with a leader and moderator who care - to be very mentally safe. Even positive influences. So I am focusing on hobbies, local events, activities I care about (e.g.: climate change), and groups I value (e.g.: I follow Jesus, so I search for understanding particularly around the Sermon on the Mount (brilliant teaching on how to live a well lived life...relevant to anyone from one of the most amazing teachers...there are several amazing online social groups that fill many happy hours). Perhaps folks should get together and form their own social groups and then we can federate together. WELL DONE ON YOUR EFFORTS!!!\n\nAuthor: None\nScore: 3",

Sedating your emotions isn't love, but sometimes it's necessary. If it is, start building the tools first you'll need to support what you're sedating for when it's no longer sedated. It's a big shift. Sometimes you need to learn a new support structure, have a plan, and then just one day decide from this moment on no more X (not tomorrow), and ensure you don't go overkill replacing it with something equally hard to quit. Or just be mindful if you are how that may be an issue too. Many people quitting smoking or drinking supplement the dopamine with eating and smoking weed for example. Don't let your mind and cravings bargain with you once you've started. But also don't set yourself up for failure by doing more than you can handle at a time you might burnout and binge like crazy when you give in.\n\nAuthor: EastCoastEnthusiast\nScore: 1",

I'm finding it hard to understand how euthanasia would be preferable to downsizing, moving to a less expensive place like a small town, renting a cheap room, having roommates, or using a shelter or living in a car temporarily to save extra money for retirement. I'm in Canada where health care is free, and there are subsidies for care homes, so that may be part of the difference, but I'm likely missing some additional context for what's led you to this conclusion.\n\nAuthor: lovetimespace\nScore: 5",

That meditation or that being fully aware with what's happening here and now has nothing to do with any story about the world about ourselves about anything at all. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything. So there's nothing to disassociate from. We're cutting off all the stories that we tell ourselves or that the world tells us and we're just practicing to be aware. In meditation you're just being aware, in disassociation you're kind of not being very aware and maybe not being very aware in relationship to something or someone or some situation that you identify with. So it's not just mindfulness that is important but mindfulness with detachment\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 24",

Be open to the fact that you're thinking mind is basically a raving lunatic that you shouldn't listen to. And even though that raving lunatic is there with you or there with your awareness instead of trying to get rid of it or trying to fight with it you can learn to accept it and see it as it is. Just nonsense. There's nothing more nonsensical than being an enemy to ourselves. You have to be willing to follow up you have to be willing to follow through you have to be willing to start using your gut and your intuition and your heart instead of just using your thinking mind. Otherwise everything that you do will be based on thinking. And if that thinking is flawed which for most people it is than that thinking will lead them to more and more suffering.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 17",

Other than that don’t give so much importance to this narrative you have about your life and the difficulties of the life you’re describing is that it’s like everything is a sign post bringing you back to this established narrative . There’s a really wonderful Korean Zen master that I recommend you listen to named Pomnyun Sunim, he has videos on YouTube. And he talks about how four wives they may have this idea that the husband that they go to sleep with is the same husband that they wake up with, but actually every day is a new life. Each day is like the first day and the last day of our life so bringing up that view of freshness is very important in dealing with the people that we are responsible for and care about. There’s another Zen saying that might seem to be inconvenient but actually is a very joyful invitation for transformation and that is that if you don’t have enough time in your daily life to sit for 15 minutes a day and follow your breathing then you better sit for 30 minutes a day and follow your breathing. OK, so good luck and send my well wishes to your family and your children.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 11",

Walking meditation can be really helpful for that so just saying hey to yourself I wanna go and meditate. I’m gonna put down everything that I’m involved with and where I’m at and all that and just go and walk and breathe and enjoy nature. And from there getting some access to that peaceful openness, you can listen to a talk from a great teacher or a great friend on the path like this one from Thich Nhat Hanh. https://youtu.be/b5gMJ1BovQ0?si=50cmEQghb_68cyH4 It’s something to really enjoy.

And secondly you should remember that you are there and that it's okay for you to just be there. In the real world like the world of Truth or the world of the way the things actually are we don't know what's happening outside of our direct experience. So you have to allow that sense of homesickness or a sense of dread or worry to actually be something for you to take in and digest and transform instead of trying to figure it out. And then you can really let your heart and your mind settle and appreciate where you are and appreciate that everything changes and no matter what you have to accept that. So accept it. And enjoy the acceptance of just being where You are.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 11",

So I try to share myself and be accessible online in lotta different ways not really so that I can promote myself, but just so that people who may need help and support have a chance for a direct connection that’s not based in some particular technique or philosophy because that’s never what gave me the most benefit~ I do eclectic Guided Meditation and Sharing Live on my channel almost everyday and livestreamed myself answering some of the questions here.

Most monks have a more balanced kind of lived experience so the idealized aggrandized kind of romanticized monk life is available, but is much more rare than being a monk and having social responsibilities and being a teacher being a community leader or just being a monk someone who’s taking refuge in the the sangha.

When our life is basically completely devoid of stepping outside of ourselves to help others then our life is all about ourself and usually that means it's all about us fulfilling our desires and avoiding our sufferings. So that is a life that's primed for addiction. Where is if you adjust the direction of your life to be more seriously concerned with self-sacrifice or generosity or doing good deeds or opening yourself up to the unknown in terms of how you live your life then addictions will be much more difficult to take root.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 8",

So in that way, how can we fight or force our view of self onto someone? It wouldn’t make much sense from an enlightened perspective unless there’s a practical situation where we are trying to help someone that’s looking to us for guidance and we may feel like calling them out and saying hey you don’t have it would be helpful , so they would be less attached to their ego. But it’s very, very easy to get attached to our own ego in approaching others because we think we have it and they don’t . Actually, my view about spiritual attainment specifically in the Buddhist framework, which I think is particularly stable and workable is that it’s a community system . To help guide and support those who have faith to go deeper on the path of mindfulness and detachment or freedom from clinging or freedom from appearances. I mentioned in another comment that I share my cell phone online like this, and I try to be very accessible to people because what benefited me most and gave me the most guidance on my path which has been going on for more than 10 years and coming from a place of very deep suffering Was direct experience in community meeting, meditation masters, meeting people who embodied wisdom and compassion, and having that kind of mind to mind experience, so it wasn’t about a particular philosophy or technique, but it was about how I stepped out from the way I was living my life and found a better way to live my life through that stepping out rather than adding something onto that.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 7",

All those terms kind of arise and disappear in a smoke of awareness of reality just as it is right now that doesn’t have anything to do with thinking about anything. So I approach all of those questions on a case by case basis.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 5",

Literally at the end of the day, we’re all just human beings and we all have the same fundamental wish , we don’t want to suffer anymore. You know, you have to look at this from the view of the Buddha in terms of starting the community of monks. He literally accepted a serial killer to be a monk, and whether or not that monk had enlightenment or lived in a particular way, most of us are the people of the city who heard about this very evil very negative person who is now become the monk and is following the Buddha and we wished for his death you know we wished for his punishment, but the Buddha didn’t see it like that, and he actually protected this monk and said that he changed his life and was Actually concerned now with the path. So of course, they’re always some extreme examples but in general, we don’t respect monks as individuals. We respect what they represent, which is the path the robes of the Buddha and we learn to stop judging other people or making the idea in our mind of being the punisher or the judge, and actually we turn the mind around to take responsibility for our own practice . So that’s my feeling on it\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 5",

This is basically everyone's problem even people who have experience in meditation. So you need to not take that problem personally and see that thoughts and experiences are just cause and effect they're not yours. Thinking is not your possession. It's just something that happens. So instead of trying to control it or get rid of it just see how it happens and how it stops happening and instead of perpetuating the thought of I having this or I having that just give your attention to breathing and a relaxed and gentle and open way and enjoy breathing and enjoy thoughts appearing and disappearing without holding on to them.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 5",

How can we stay safe from being taken advantage of?\n\nComment: This is a really common question and concern that a lot of people have. It would seem to me to be the difference between non-discriminatory mindfulness with attachment versus non-discriminatory mindfulness with detachment . So as long as we develop a relationship with detachment or a relationship with awareness of reality, as it actually is so awareness of reality, according to the three marks of existence , impermanence, no self, Suffering. Then it’s really difficult for people to take advantage of us . So it’s not forgiveness without discernment and it’s a forgiveness that’s more non-so it’s more like openness and non-involvement with unnecessary attachment points in our own minds or in the outward environment . So it’s kind of like a constant practice of stepping back and being aware and so when you are constantly stepping back and being aware, you’re grounded in the nature of awareness and you have your full faculties of discernment and self protection, etc. it’s just that you’re no longer falling into the wrong belief that there is actually a separate someone who’s doing something or who can be taken advantage of. In this way, you can do whatever you like to do, but you do it without attachment, and this is a kind of natural protection . So it’s like the difference between being convinced by everything or everything being a point for not being convinced and just being aware and then you can participate in a lot of exploration, experimentation and testing.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 4",

So finding a teacher or community that are simple and based in wisdom and compassion is very important if you want to avoid some unnecessary side effects. But also if you meditate very seriously you may find yourself as something new and fresh in a world where Newness and freshness is not particularly valued. And you may find that your culture has basically no background in the meditation path or the kind of experience that that will lead one to so it can be very isolating and confusing.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 3",

But now it feels more relaxed mainly because I have a community of people who support me in my own online sharing and teaching. If you wanna call it that. This is the thing that actually I had a lot of stress and difficulty with in becoming a monk, and then sharing my monk life with the world is that there are so many preconceived notions that people have about kind of an exceptional and idealized view of what a monk is and how a monk lives and most monks are more normal in human Than some kind of saintly person. And that humanity is kind of at the core of being a monk and there’s culturally an inside and an outside so it’s all about how you perform or how you act outwardly but then internally you’re still completely human and dealing with all these things and not at all some saintly personality . And I’ve encountered a lot of frustration from people in terms of them, letting go of their idealized view of what a monk is and realizing that it’s completely a human activity and everyone who is a monk is just a human underneath the robes. There’s a lot of flexibility and accessibility in terms of becoming a monk, and how you live that life . Some monks have jobs some monks or even most monks don’t follow all of the rules, but just follow the most strict ones about no sexual activity no stealing no killing and no making false claims about their enlightenment . Yes, sometimes it’s like a whole day where mindfulness is an accessible and there’s like a state of depression or worry and frustration, but if I cannot hold so strongly to my identity of being someone who is supposed to be mindful, then when those clouds of depression are difficulty past I can just come back to my practice and I don’t need to linger in that complicated thinking about myself that makes me suffer more.\n\nAuthor: Monk-Life\nScore: 2",

My depressed mind was littered or backlogged with depressive, self-fulfilling thinking patterns. The action of bringing myself to the moment and allowing myself to rest in the subsequent space created from that, repeatedly, helped clear up that backlog and made way for me to set new, healthier intentions, relative to the depression. edit: you have to believe you can make it to the other side of it, despite the internal nagging feeling that you're doomed.

I'm sorry you're going through it. I hope you feel better soon. Someone once said we could think of the word depress as deep rest. That you need deep rest from trying to be the identity that you think you ought to be because it's not working and it's exhausting and saps you of all your joy and energy. Notice, how, in that sentence, there is a \"You\" and an \"identity\". How they are two different things. Knowing this difference, SEEING it, realising it experientially, is the key. This can be easier said than done. It's a subtle fluctuation of our minds, it's not material or matter like we usually try to observe and some of our minds may actively try to work against us as we try. All this to say, challenges are natural and part of the process but if you stick to it and you practice, it will become easy. If you're introspective, you can try to notice how in your internal dialogue, there is always one part of you who is ALWAYS asking the questions and another part that ALWAYS answers. The part that asks is always the \"mind\" (of which identity is a subset) and the part of you that answers is always \"you\" And \"you\" is just awareness. It is literally, the faculty and ability to be conscious and aware. There is no object to \"be aware of\". Literally, the you that YOU ARE, is always and constantly and unceasingly aware because if you weren't, that's what we call death. You ARE aware all the time, have always been and will always be. You do not have to try to be aware, you simply have to realise that you are. I hope this helps. I am not a Buddhist monk. But I did learn what I know from someone who was a monk trained in meditation for ~7 years and I started learning 5.5 years ago myself. If that should tell you anything, it's that it's natural for these things to take time. There are no shortcuts, only experience and OP is both wise and experienced to wish you patience.\n\nAuthor: ItSmellsLikeRain2day\nScore: 1",

Read Daily Stoic principles. Listen to Frequench Hertz music - 528Hz is for cell regeneration. There are different frequencies out there but I use 528Hz frequency. Meditation is about sitting still and having NO racing next step thoughts. It's about being PRESENT IN THE MOMENT. Surfing used to be my therapy. Those giant waves forced me to forget about a failed relationship, office politics, apartment court case etc. I had to literally be in the present to navigate the waves crashing on me - survival out in rough surf conditions. Now that I don't live in a city near an ocean - I resort to salt baths and I try to practice mindfulness. I try to be in nature - just listening to the trees, birds, watching the butterflies.... there is some frequency out there that I am trying to tap into. Just that process itself is Meditation- connecting to nature - and understanding/ tapping into their instinct levels. I also use Vedic Astrology a lot. You don't have to be Hindu - but it helped me understand why my personality is such. I did consult an astrologer who was extremely sincere to explain how the planets are affecting me and how I need to learn to detach, and hone in on my natural gut instinct. It's not that easy. But what is harder is to lose yourself to the everyday noise. Make your time YOUR TIME. Understand that we are all connected- everyone entered this plane of existence through different levels of consciousness. Some people are meant to learn and experience more - and others are meant to not dig deeper in their current physical form. Your soul has a purpose 🙏🏽\n\nAuthor: whoknowswhattimeitis\nScore: -1",

I'm also live on YouTube right now so you can come and connect that way. https://www.youtube.com/live/MypO8kaGBzI?si=OIb7ySjvZqF_YSDn I just wanted to add a little bit of clarification on this response because I see that a lot of people immediately downloaded that. There's nothing more valuable and useful from my experience to get more connected with a practical path than to connect with someone who's been on the path. My entire spiritual development in life and becoming a monk and leading up to being a monk and over the past 7 years has been defined by direct experiences that I've had with other human beings who have been on the path and gone through things. So when someone asks me directly what is your best advice about how to get started and actually access going forward. Hey cross your fingers to be able to meet someone who's actually walked that mountain path that you're interested in walking. Not everything is driven by greed and ego we can also drive the car of generosity and openness to connect with other people and help them without expecting something from them.

I created this oil painting to support an organization that offers trauma-informed yoga and meditation to people in prison. During my visit to a prison in Veracruz, I witnessed firsthand how these practices help incarcerated individuals improve sleep, reduce anxiety, and regulate their emotions. One participant shared that, for the first time in 17 years, he’s been able to sleep through the night without panic attacks. Their work is incredibly impactful. Hope you like it!\n\nAuthor: mlgev96\nScore: 4",

After a while, the rain came, and people were prepared to congratulate the sage for calling down the weather. The guy just laughed and admitted that he didn't bring the rain, he just went off because there was too much chaos and anxiety in the town and he wanted somewhere more chill to wait out the drought.\n\nAuthor: doctormink\nScore: 5",

When I stopped chasing happiness, I realized that it might never be a constant state, but rather moments of relief within the complexity of my own being. I learned to listen to what was behind the emotions, unspoken desires, old fears, and voices that weren't mine but that I carried. Noticing peace began with this: stopping the self-judgment and starting to listen to myself with honesty. And in that space, peace stopped being a destination... and became a possible place within me.\n\nAuthor: None\nScore: 8",

And when I get tired and worn out from the misery, I see I forgot what keeps me here, what makes life worthwhile, and that's my love for my loved ones, wanting the best for them.

Do you have a daily practice or ritual?\n\nComment: Something I've incorporated into my routine and that has made a significant difference is the daily recording of automatic thoughts, especially those that arise during moments of emotional discomfort. The first step is to the thought as it appears, without filters. Then, I analyze its content more closely: I ask myself whether I'm generalizing, catastrophizing, or assuming something is true based on fear or insecurity. This practice helps me distinguish between a momentarily emotional reaction and what actually makes sense in light of reality. Just the act of writing already brings mental clarity, but the real impact lies in gaining distance from dysfunctional thought patterns. It's a form of training in self-awareness and emotional regulation. Over time,I began to notice that certain repetitive ideas stopped carrying the same weight. And it was through this process of looking at what I think and feel with more clarity, that I started to find something more stable than immediate happiness: a state of inner peace that doesn't rely so much on circumstances, but rather on how I relate to what happens to me.\n\nAuthor: None\nScore: 4",

In coziness, comfortable solitude, and unhurried or relaxed hours. As long as we have enough of those moments, and as long as we’re at peace with ourselves, we might come to see our life as a happy one. It’s never about the absence of suffering, because that’s unrealistic, but about our ability to move through it. Every moment, every emotion, every season is impermanent. Good or bad. I find that impermanence is comforting, in a way. I feel like life is made of moments.\n\nAuthor: Admirable_Escape352\nScore: 4",

I just need to be present for it.\n\nReplying to: stumbling upon your words reminded me of this brief quote that I had coincidentally just read earlier today on a kombucha bottle: “Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.\"\n\nComment: >“Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.\" -Søren Kierkegaard Love this. Such a truth. >it was a humble cue for me to release whatever expectations ive been holding onto about myself, others, the world, and the future. it’s true, life really is about the journey itself as a process and not so much the particular destination(s) we’re all collectively killing ourselves over via burnout while trying to reach. This is a profound realization that so many never reach. I’ve been realizing it and putting it into practice this entire year of turning 60. It’s been a hard year — this age — and with regret, depression, ‘if only’ thoughts, deep realization that I have more yesterdays than tomorrows. Just a year of mental angst. Add to this that I’ve struggled with anxiety, insomnia, complex stress and for years and years due to life events and manifestations of those. There’s always been something to navigate, something to solve, something to avoid, something to predict. It’s really mentally exhausting to live like this and in turn physically exhausting. As I reach my 61st birthday, strong messengers (spiritual mainly) have exactly relayed to me in many ways OPs quote. It seems like all of the sudden I’m just willing to let things go now. It sounds so cliche but I’m just wanting days to unfold now and being more present and accepting of what presents itself. At work. In relationships. In family. In self. I have to let go of the grip of predicting, controlling, organizing because I have skills. And they will be there to deal with things as they arrive. Last night at mass it just hit me like a ton of bricks. Stop wishing things away. Stop wishing your life was different. This is the life God has given to me — my good health, kind neighbors, a career with good people, an old home that needs work, my little commuter car, my adult children nearby adulting like there’s no tomorrow, my 3 tiny grandchildren I get to see whenever I want. Sit back now and be thankful. And let it all go. This is your life.\n\nAuthor: TrixnTim\nScore: 3",

I listened to a podcast over a decade ago that I cannot stop thinking about. It was talking about sleep, and it got to talking about how our brains are built to wander, they are meant to be bored. When we have quiet, down time our brains will process through thoughts and kinda work through everything weighing on the mind. In today's day and age, we are always actively doing something: talking to people at work, looking at screen, listening to music in car, probably have earbuds in with a podcast or music when walking, driving, or doing chores. What happens is that we lay down to go to sleep, and it's the first time our brains have been allowed to wander all day, and then you have the \"I can't fall asleep because my brain won't shut up!\" Well, of course it won't, you haven't let it talk all day! So, anyway, all that to say... sometimes going on the walk just to listen to the birds or other ambient noises, and letting your brain wander, can still be helpful.\n\nAuthor: goyangicatgato\nCommunity Score: 39",

However, if you don't and you lose out on opportunities because you didn't, you absolutely will regret that. Also, if you focus on what you love about living life not smoking weed, over time that will become your new norm. If you do it well enough, you will feel like your friends who still smoke weed are missing out by smoking weed. Live to learn how to get so much out of the present moment, that the only thing weed could ever do is at best water it down and at worst prevent you from truly, deeply loving being alive and present.

Drop the why, focus only on how. Is your anger in your stomach, your chest, your throat? Does it vibrate, burn, push? Is it sharp, heavy, rhythmic? If you zoom into the sensations, can you find gaps between them? If you zoom out, how do they change? If your emotion were a color, a movement, or a sound, what would it be? Don’t get lost in the descriptions, return to sensations. Explore, be patiently curious. How, not why.

That meditation or that being fully aware with what's happening here and now has nothing to do with any story about the world about ourselves about anything at all. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything. So there's nothing to disassociate from. We're cutting off all the stories that we tell ourselves or that the world tells us and we're just practicing to be aware. In meditation you're just being aware, in disassociation you're kind of not being very aware and maybe not being very aware in relationship to something or someone or some situation that you identify with.

Some subs are a balance between the two, and if you can be careful about only reading posts that are supportive and solution oriented, they can be useful. But otherwise I’ve personally found that it’s best to just avoid most of these subs altogether unless you’re researching a specific topic and want to dive in for a little while. Subscribing and having them show up in my feed just magnifies the things in my own life that don’t need magnification. Spending time reading books or watching highly informative content (I found Robert Sapolky’s lectures on depression useful) has been a far better use of time. So many of the things I struggle with boil down to habits and patterns of thought. If I spend time in spaces filled with other people playing out the same patterns, it just reinforces the seeming realness of my own instead of allowing me to move away from it.

And even though that raving lunatic is there with you or there with your awareness instead of trying to get rid of it or trying to fight with it you can learn to accept it and see it as it is.

    "content": "Context: How to cope knowing you’ll always be alone?\n\nHigh-Value Response: I made a choice that was healthy and beneficial to me, by choosing to be alone. It is the best decision of my life. It was the first decision of my own that felt like it came from a place of response and choice instead of reaction, circumstance or fear. Something that may help you if you try; DON'T SAY; I'm unattractive. I'm not smart. I have nothing going for me. DO TRY SAYING; I am perfect as I am. I am whole and complete. I am worthy of love. I am beautiful. I am brave. I am capable. I have everything to give. I am everything. Your mind is incredibly powerful and you will believe what you tell yourself. So if you tell yourself negative things, guess what you'll believe? And guess how you'll feel? You have the power to change this. Please forget everything shty that anyone ever said to you and replace it with a narrative that is beneficial to you. People insult others by projection. They say the things that they believe about themselves and dump it onto others. Then we start believing it about ourselves and repeating their narrative as our own. It is debilitating. When I started to change my narrative, I felt like a fraud. I would laugh at myself when I'd say; I am worthy. I did not believe it to be true. I felt ridiculous. But I kept at it and over time, I started to really see myself differently. Now I absolutely believe the beautiful things I say to myself and someone would be lucky to receive my attention and my company. This is a far cry from what I had been led to think and believe about myself. You CAN take control of your mind and CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE You have nothing to lose by trying, but you will find that you have EVERYTHING to gain by trying. When you feel like things are at a halt and not changing as you desire, just remember that Rome wasn't built in a day and this time you are alone is your time to heal. It's taken you a lifetime to believe negative things about yourself, so you must be patient and understand that it's going to take a little time to turn things around in the opposite direction. It can feel lonely, I know (pets are great!) But when there's inner work to do, it really is more important than company. Because if you do the inner work now, then you'll have the company that is genuinely worthy of your attention later, rather than just settling for anyone in leui of being alone. You know that saying; you shouldn't drink poison just because you're thirsty? This applies to the company we keep. When we feel lonely it can easily turn into allowing negative people into our energy space. This you will NOT allow once you learn to love yourself and that means that when you do meet people, you'll be selective and only let the right ones into your life. Good luck to you and please believe that you're never truly alone. But you have to believe that the power to change and choose is yours. Which it is.\n\nAuthor: SparklingNebula1111\nCommunity Score: 17",

This is going on top of my vision board. It's the main reason I'd want to have one in the first place. I've found that the \"I am someone who...\" statement/rephrasing in my head helps with this. I understand some users on here saying that true mindfulness means not attaching yourself to any labels and just \"being\", and maybe I'm too early in my journey to understand this. But for me, at this point in life, I need some sort of identity to help me make the right (for me) everyday decisions. Because if I don't, I feel regret or sadness, and that doesn't feel great either.
