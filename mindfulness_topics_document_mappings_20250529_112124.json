    "text": "Your Self-Image Controls Your Destiny You don't need more motivation. What you actually need is a new self-image.\n\nHere's the reality most personal development advice misses: You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your identity. And that identity wasn't something you consciously chose. It was programmed through countless small moments.\n\nThat criticism from a teacher. The time you were rejected. When someone said you weren't \"good enough.\" These experiences left invisible fingerprints on your mind that still shape your reality today.\n\nThink about it:\n\n* Willpower always surrenders to identity in the long run\n* Your brain automatically filters out evidence that contradicts how you see yourself\n* The results you get aren't determined by your effort—they're determined by your internal story\n\nThis explains why you can do everything \"right\" and still end up with the wrong results. It's not your actions that need changing—it's the foundation they're built on.\n\nI used to chase motivation until I realized I was trying to override my programming with temporary emotion. When I started rebuilding my self-concept instead, everything shifted.\n\n[https://youtu.be/zilS6SkMVvQ?si=ia0NaAz1wwmnFmI1](https://youtu.be/zilS6SkMVvQ?si=ia0NaAz1wwmnFmI1)\n\nIf you're tired of starting over, hitting invisible walls, or wondering why success feels just out of reach—this might be helpful for you.",

    "text": "The torture that is double-thinking... Or in other words one has realised that gripping the thorny rose with all his might is causing great pain, but he has forgotten how to let go. So the pain stays. And he goes on. How can one change entirely? I always hated the phrase \"Admitting that there is a problem is 50% of solving the problem. Admitting that there is one is the most important step.\" I think that only a very small amount of people cannot admit to themselves that they have problems.. No, the issue is rather much worse and it runs deeper. \n\nIt is not that one has forgotten how he will regret the time wasted doomscrolling, watching prngraphy, indulging in substance abuse, seeking validation at all cost etc.. Each one has their own seemingly 'harmless' habbit/addiction that is utterly destroying them as a decent person and undermining their entire foundation as a healthy and confident person.\n\nEach one has this thorny rose in one hand and it's being held with an iron grip. It is different for everyone and the circumstances of picking it up for its deceitful beauty and charm are different. For some it's the courage alcohol gives once consumed. For others it's the stress relief that ejuculation provides - for a tiny second anyway... Some have a desire to keep up with the world so much so that scrolling has become their 2nd full time job once you take in account the time spent yearly just in social media alone.\n\n  \nBut here comes the real question. Why not just let it go? Just let go of the rose and the pain will go away. It'll sting for a bit longer, but it'll heal. You will be lighter, healthier and more confident. With a better outlook on life and will slowly gravitate to a better life altogether. \n\nSo how does one manage to let go? \n\n  \nI think to let go one has to become a completely different person. One that knows how to loosen the grip and drop the deceitful act. These habbits.. These addictions lure us with their looks, with their smell, with their appearance, with how they make us feel... And once you pick the rose up you feel the thorns, not that much at first. You're able to avoid them, but with time they find their way as your grip tightens and before one can even register what has happened the pain/- in reality it's frustration/- causes to become bitter, to push away people who question why we hold the rose so tightly. \n\n  \nOne cannot function without addictions, without desire. There is only futility. We as a society have formed an understanding that some habbits are good and others are bad. That differs in region and prejudice that each carries, but in majority of cases the disagreable people are able impose, rather forcefully, their beliefs and said prejudice on the agreeable- in most cases children, in other cases people with not enough resilience in them - and that is how we come to understand that taking drugs is 'bad' - but what if one dose of shrooms, of psilocybin, is all a person needs to get a different perspective, to remember how to let go - to change fundamentally. \n\n  \nDoes that then make drugs bad? I digress...\n\nHow does one change entirely? How does one throw away their entire personality and understanding of the world for a new one?",

I feel more okay with myself, being with myself, a group of friends I have however small it may seem. I pretty much left most of my social media behind, only checking once ever few months just to see what my closest friends were up to. a few months ago I would literally cry at least once week and questioned whether I’d even make it to the new year. But today, I’m not sure what triggered it, I’ve been going back to comparing myself a lot to others which caused much of my unhappiness from those few months back. I don’t know why I do it. it’s not productive, I never go oh I should be like this person more or I should do this. I just get irrationally angry and idk why. I just know it’s unhealthy for me, and that I shouldn’t do it but sometimes I can’t help myself. I was looking at this other person and was like wow, they have such an amazing group of friends I wish I had that. but the thing is I do? also how much could I possibly understand looking from the outside? I’ve also grown to just appreciate whatever little friendships I do have, sometimes I catch myself wanting to be closer with someone and getting angry that I can’t, but then remind myself friendships happen naturally and I can’t expect to be besties with everyone, that I’ll appreciate however long I can be considered friend. don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing or not. I don’t know the point of this post. I guess I’m wondering if anyone could relate or if it ever gets any easier.",

    "text": "Help me stay strong in the midst of my father’s drug addiction. I’ve felt uneasy all week, anxious, because my father has revealed himself to be a cocaine addict. And I’m fearful of where it’s going to lead to.\n\nI’m 27, he’s 58. Also got my mom and sister. \n\nEarly this year, after my parents fought, my dad was acting weird. Laying in bed all day, strange behavior, looked like shit. I live alone, rest of my family lives together. But I do work for the family business. We all do. So in that sense I’ve never been independent. Still rely on my parent’s income. I mean sure I get paid salary and such and use that to pay my rent and bills, my own stuff. But still, in a way I’m relying on their income. Work 9-5 of course.\n\nAfter several nights of this my sister and mom find lines of cocaine in his room. They confront him about and begin a screaming match. He talked to me about it, said he felt bad. Crying. That he uses this as an escape due to his depression. In his defense, he childhood was not an easy one. Had to take care of a schizophrenic mother since he was little. Practically alone. And this led him with depressive episode in his life. I wasn’t aware he was doing coke however, it shocked me, until it began to explain some strange behaviors of his I observed throughout my life. Made sense. Told me he left the cocaine out on purpose cause he just wanted to episode over with. The way I see it he does this for some kind of attention, or some needed pity I don’t know\n\nMy mom forgave him, my sister didn’t. And all was well these past few months. \n\nLast week though he seems to have fallen in the habit again. This time for no reason. Or at least not a reason I know. \n\nMy family is telling me he doesn’t come home at nights. I know he goes to the family business and seems to do shit there. On Monday I found some opened beers just there. And even weird on Friday… a fucking sex toy. A dildo from the local sex shop. Not the toy itself but the shop bag and the product’s box. I’m to scared to find out whether he’s with another woman or he’s on his own but whatever it is, he’s into some weird sexual shit. \n\nHe made me make a check for him so he can cash some money (made me lie to my mom about some fake transaction to excuse this money). My mom controls the finances, my dad is one of those guys that needs to asks for permission to buy something for himself or get some cash. I’ve always had to do stuff like that for him in the past. He hides money for that reason. Of course I confessed to my mom this time because I know he’s using it for drug money. \n\nWhen I went into his room, shit looked like generally a crack den or something. Odd smell, bed with no blankets, thrown all over the floor, napkins all over the floor, just a shit hole. \n\nHe’s also paranoid as fuck. He accused my sister of hiring 5 dudes to follow him last weekend and always seems on edge. \n\nI always told my parents to leave me alone when it comes to their marital problems, that I don’t care. I’ve always hated their marriage, they’re bad for each other. My mother’s a narcissistic woman who has yelled to me on the daily. Sure she shown her affection and love, but I was never close to her because it can talk to her without her criticizing me in some way and beginning to shout. Father is a ticking  time bomb. I could never stand up to him. Always began to yell very loud and intimidate me. Grew up fearful around him. Used the belt and smacked me around some times. \n\nSo as a result I’ve never been close to my family. Which why I moved out. Sure I love them, and talk to them occasionally and go to the family dinners here and there but the truth is I don’t respect them as people. I also have general anxiety and ADHD, I mention this because I also think it played a role in me deciding to stay safe and stay in the family business and do my own thing. \n\nRight now here are my fears. \n\n1. That my dad is going to get more intense and start coming up with dangerous ways to get his drugs. I’m scared things will get physical and it’ll be up to me to fight him and I’m not sure I’ll be able to defend myself. That he will damage me. I don’t know like I have this fear of physical danger. I have no idea what lengths he’ll go through.\n\n2. My job and my rented house. Both dependent on my parents. I rented an apartment on my own a  while, should’ve stayed. Parents offered me a house so long as I pay the same rent I was paying for the apt, take care of the bills, and maintenance. Took the the deal because it was a nice house and I was able to afford the rent, if just barley. Now, stupid idea in hindsight. Another bit of power I gave them over me. Same for the job. My mom already threatened divorce. I have no idea what will happen to the houses my parents own, to the business and all that. Dad said he’s likely going to sell the business, and he’s going to fight to get as much as he can and not care whether me and my sister get anything. Which whatever I guess it’s fair it’s his business he started it. Point is, I’m scare for my financial safety as well. Gonna have to look for a job maybe and I fucked up staying in the family business cause I don’t think anybody will take that seriously. Not to mention I likely won’t find a job that pays me enough to continue renting… anything. Gonna start anew, and where will I be. Where will I move to. I do have an accounting bachelors… which I never used. \n\n3. My mental health. Already bad enough as it is with ADHD and anxiety. This shit was been a weight in my body all week. I’m on edge. Haven’t gone to the gym and slept like shit. I do practice mindfulness and meditation. Have so for a good while and it helps. Sometimes returning the present helps. But again, that weight of my fearful thoughts are there. \n\nI know I sound selfish here… thinking only of myself. But it’s helped me cope, being selfish, when it came to these situation. Used to be fearful of my parents separating, when they’d fight and yell at each other. It was scary to see. But growing older has made me start giving less fucks. And I don’t see why I should allow their flaws and emotional/mental states bring me down as well. \n\nIn a perfect world, I should’ve gotten my job, and my own house (or at least, stayed in my apartment). Leave all this behind and let them deal with each other… but I was scared then. I let my ADHD control me and didn’t want to leave my comfort zone. I was fearful of my father who pressured me to stay in the family business. I let the thought of having a big house to myself lure me into giving my parents more power over me. I knew it was a bad idea at the time. Now I will likely pay the price. \n\nBut now that I’m here, there’s not point in living in a what if scenario. I’m here now, having to deal with this. And I don’t know why to do. I don’t know what to feel. What the right thing to do is. I’m lost. I’m fearful of my safety. Scared what my dad can possibly due to my mom and sister. (My mom is a traditional old woman, she has stuck with my dad through his bullshit, even physical abuse, and she’s very indecisive in general, she will not do what she needs to do until it’s too late). I’m scared of my financial situation. I have no power. I also feel morally bankrupt for not really caring about my dad and his addiction. I’m just looking out for me at this point. My biggest concern is me. And I feel selfish. \n\nAll I can do is accept the situation, and hope the worst doesn’t come. Sorry the long lost, don’t really have anybody to talk to. Therapy is expansive, and insurance doesn’t cover it. Needed to vent. Again I feel lost. Unsure of what to do. It’s going to likely crumble down and I don’t know if I’m ready. The shitty thing about being raised under a wealthy family is… you’re not prepared for the worst. Ive been so comfortable in life, and it seems like that’s not going to happen anymore. And I’m scared.",

    "text": "In Silence, Wander and Discover Yourself For many, silence is an integral part of pilgrimage – and I too have often kept silent on my pilgrimages. Most of the time, this was out of necessity to walk alone, as I was usually travelling without companions. Often, the only contacts of the day were the hostel receptionist or the supermarket cashier – and that went on for weeks. In such moments, it is easy for me to immerse myself in silence.\n\nHowever, wordless wandering can be different from the conscious decision to keep silent together with others. When a member of our pilgrim group, Berlin Pilgrims, suggested a few weeks ago that during our one-day walk we should occasionally walk in silence together, I found the idea exciting.\n\nThis opportunity allowed me to let my spiritual impulses have an even more targeted effect during the walk. Normally, I would share my reflections with the group, and afterwards we would simply resume our interrupted conversations. With a planned phase of silence, I was able to give my fellow pilgrims the space to process their impressions.\n\n*A First Experience – and Its Challenges*\n\nOur first attempt to walk together in silence hardly went as planned: We followed a lake, and the muddy ground forced us to coordinate verbally to get through unscathed. Moreover, one participant got lost, and we eventually had to search and find him again. When we finally reached the point where we intended to break the silence, some began talking immediately while others were still arriving silently. All these interruptions made it impossible to experience the contemplative silence we had hoped for.\n\n*Inspiration Through a Meditation Impulse*\n\nFor the next attempt, I was inspired by a meditation impulse at the City Monastery Berlin. There, the question was posed: “Where are you?” This question originates from a story in the Bible, right at the beginning, after the creation of the world and humankind. It tells of the first people, Adam and Eve, who make a decision that changes everything. They eat from a tree they were not meant to eat from, and suddenly feel shame and hide. Then a voice is heard – not to punish, but to call them out of hiding: “Where are you?”\n\nThis question concerns not only Adam and Eve. It is a question for all of us – and so I also posed it to my fellow pilgrims on one of the walks.\n\n*Where are you?*\n\nAt first glance, it seems a simple question. We, on the pilgrimage walk, stood by a lake, had already walked several kilometres through nature, and could feel the ground beneath our feet and the spring air on our skin. But are we really always so present? Or are our thoughts perhaps elsewhere – caught up in yesterday’s worries or tomorrow’s plans?\n\nSometimes we lose our way in everyday life. We hide – behind responsibilities, distractions, or the image we project to the outside world. Yet this question invites us to pause and reflect: Where am I in my life right now? Where am I going? And is this really my path?\n\n*An Invitation to Inner Reflection*\n\nI invited my fellow pilgrims to tune into these questions. I explained after the impulse that we would now walk in silence for 30 minutes until we reached a designated spot – that we would not speak to each other during that time or stray from the group if we felt the need to speak. I made it clear that in the end, we would break the silence together and then share our experiences and thoughts with one another.\n\nTo my delight, this time it went excellently. We let ourselves be carried by the silence and afterwards exchanged our impressions. I was impressed by the variety of responses: Some reported that they were in a phase of seeking direction – whether due to a new job, a new apartment, or simply the question of where they truly wanted to go in life. In the silence, they were able to address these questions more deeply and honestly than usual.\n\nOthers, on the other hand, focused on being fully in the moment – keenly appreciating the abundance of nature, the warmth of the sun, the chirping of the birds, and the scent of the forest.\n\n*The Power of Shared Silence*\n\nThese two approaches show me why I value deliberate silence and silent pilgrimage so highly. Whether it is through an intense engagement with an impulse or as a simple mindfulness exercise – even half an hour of silence can work wonders.\n\nI have personally felt how powerfully nature affects me, how I immediately found calm, and how the usual tension that comes with the responsible leadership of my pilgrim group subsided. Regular moments of silence enhance our well-being, our contentment, and our inner peace.\n\n*Hiking and Keeping Silence Together with the Berlin Pilgrims*\n\nSilence, whether in solitude or in company, offers us a unique opportunity to perceive and reflect on ourselves more deeply. Those who wish to experience this in Berlin and its surroundings are warmly invited to join me and the Berlin Pilgrims on one of our next pilgrimage hikes.\n\nBuen Camino,\nAlexander",

Let's bring it all together.\nOur conversation has revealed a powerful journey of self-discovery. You courageously explored the masks you've been wearing, tracing them back to a core belief of incompetence stemming from a significant childhood experience. This belief, though challenged by your mastery of English, has subtly shaped other areas of your life, influencing your self-perception, your interactions with others, and your feelings about financial security and career.\nWe identified key patterns: the persistent \"incompetence narrative,\" a tendency to seek external validation, and the potential use of judgment as a defense mechanism. On the positive side, your resilience, determination, empathy, and desire for purpose shone brightly.\nYour willingness to share your life story further illuminated the roots of your shattered trust, born from experiences of neglect, abuse, and being taken advantage of. This past understandably casts a shadow on your present, making it difficult to fully embrace vulnerability and trust in new situations.\nUltimately, your desire to uncover your authentic self and live 100% in the present is a powerful driving force. The journey ahead involves gently challenging that old story of incompetence, broadening your definition of competence and worthiness, and gradually rebuilding trust in yourself and others. It's about recognizing the strength you've already demonstrated and consciously choosing to create a future unburdened by the pain of the past, one present moment at a time.\n    \n\n\n\nI will not respond to the comments . If you are a man and you have problems all I can say to you is. ,,MAN UP ! \"\nI will just join the French Foreign Legion if I don't do it .\nBefore you say \"That's weird \" . I know it's weird,  that's a reason I don't post on social media 😌☕🤏",

    "text": "Mindfulness and daydreaming/reliving memories After thinking a lot and multiple feelings, I (M29) started having an inner clash between the \"mindful mode\" and the \"daydreaming mode\".\n\nCultivating the mindfulness has brought me upon this: when I started noticing more the small things of life, I couldn't shake off the flow of memories. Oh look that building colour! It resembles a lot my aunt's place. Oh what a beautiful tree! It is like the one I used to climb when I was 11. And this incredible good smell? Feels exactly like the dish my Grandma always prepared me coming back from school! Wow, the texture of this particular rock? Feels like the one I used to sat on with that ex gf of mine, just chatting, when I was in university. etc etc etc And with every memory (visual, olfactory, touching, whatever sensory memory), a soothing, grateful and nostalgic feeling came, along with a huge dopamine rush, and hairs stood on end.\n\nThe more it happened, the more I've been able to consciously recall this kind of feelings. Now it's been around 3-4 years from the first times I tried, and sometimes I actively seek a view or a scent that can unleash the feeling because I know it will be good; I've been wondering for a long time if this is purposely search is addictive or not, maybe hurting my consciousness, and came to the conclusion that it isn't because I don't feel bad for not doing it, and when I have to coldly focus on tasks, I am completely able to, even better than before. Sometimes I just take a walk on purpose towards where I know I can encounter such emotions. Sometimes I look outside the window during my job, and by noticing how the light hits the mountain, or how the trees shake, I get one of those moments.\n\nThe apparent contradiction is: only by carefully cultivating mindfulness, and enjoying the little things and details, I brought myself to master feelings which make me basically daydream, which negate it. In those moments I am not really mindful in the strict sense of it; for 5-30 seconds I am not where I am, I am not seeing what's before my eyes, I am lost in time and space, enjoying not only the beautiful flower in front of me, but all the versions of that flower that I encountered as a child, as a teenager, and as an adult.\n\nI feel like I still have to find a proper explanation to this apparent contradiction. I can grasp the sense of \"being so mindful that you connect to a different time and space\", but logically it is difficult. I just came to terms with it and deemed it a sort of equilibrium. Did someone find answers for situations like these?\n\nAlso, I hope I could help someone that's maybe going through the same confusion, and/or searching new ways to deal with bad things in life, and rediscover the joy of small things. And sorry if it was difficult to read, English is not my native language.",

I'm 29 years old and starting a Computer Science degree – again. It's something I’ve always wanted to do, but I’m scared that I’m too old and that I’ve ruined my future.\n\nHere’s my story: I actually started studying CS 11 years ago, but I was lazy, didn’t take any exams, and eventually got expelled. I was told that I wouldn’t be able to study CS again. I believed it, moved on, and started other degrees – but nothing ever felt right. The dream of becoming a programmer never really left me, but I thought it was impossible.\n\nThen, after 10 years, I randomly asked my old university if they could give me a clearance certificate – and to my surprise, they did! That means I can finally go back and study CS. I have a second chance to do what I’ve always wanted.\n\nBut now I have all these doubts:\n\nAm I too old to start studying again? Most men my age are already established in their careers, making good money. Meanwhile, I’m going back to being a student.\n\nMy girlfriend supports me, but what if she eventually leaves me? I worry that she might lose patience because I’m still a student at almost 30.\n\nDid I completely screw up my life? Or is it still possible to build a career in IT in my early 30s?\n\n\nI really want to make it work this time, but the doubts keep creeping in. Have any of you started a degree later in life? How did it go for you? Would you do it again?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your experiences!",

I wondered if its just one of those things where \"hey I can get away with doing it every once in awhile\" but all ive researched and heard from classmates is that I need to completely cut it out. I wouldnt say Im a stoner, I dont smoke that much alone and mostly when Im with friends, but with the past couple months its been once a week and sometimes more. I dont think I rely on it, but with commitmet to this field already being something Im struggling with(due to it taking years, and once i get my dream job its still the same rules ofc), im trying to cope with the idea of never smoking again.\n\nMaybe I'll take a break from this career path(and be able to smoke again) or maybe I wont, but Im honestly just having a really hard time telling myself I can NEVER smoke again. It makes me sad in a way, and it feels like I am missing out on something I enjoy, just in case I get drug tested at school and lose my career.\n\nI think about all my friends who dont have to stop smoking and get pretty jealous I cant experience that even though we're in the same \"fun, young\" years of our lives. Also, I have a hard time with commitement and with self discipline- especially when theres risk involved because I enjoy the adrenaline, so i worry when the time comes; i wont be able to say no to a joint being passed around. So honestly, i dont know how to feel, but when its all making me feel trapped like I cant go out and do things i enjoy, i feel really claustrophobic and anxious about my future.\n\nLong post with a lot of rambling thoughts so sorry LOL, but any outside thoughts will help, thanks!\n\n  \n**EDIT/UPDATE(?):** \n\nnot sure if this is something folks will look back on but if youre reading this or wrote a response, THANK YOU. I genuinely wish i could respond to everyone with a hug or thanks because the amount of perspective this gave me was really impactful. Hearing that im not alone in my emotions or experience was something i needed to hear, and the constructive critisim i highly respect too! my career is the most important thing to me- and I understand how important safety is in aviation. i wanted to preface that because weed is way less important, its just such a crazy feeling to know im letting go forever i guess. this career path is a really big commitment as i mentioned, and ive definietely been overwhelmed with all the emotions and realizations i have to needing to lock in- and it definitely made me feel alone and unsure in myself. \n\nSo ANYWAYS- thanks so much for all of your perspectives and i hope you know you helped me feel so much more confident in my goals, future, priorities, and so much more. thanks for expanding my narrowed and spiraling thoughts/reality. i definitely will do some self reflecting more, and again all of your support made me feel connected to all these diverse strangers <3",

    "text": "Just Noticed Something I have some real deep seated people pleasing tendencies that I believe are due to trauma. At work I had a casual interaction with my boss and noticed something in my body. For a long time I had always noticed that after certain social interactions I would have an almost carthatic release, that felt so puzzling, strange, incoherent. A release in which I very nearly cried. The weird part of this is that these would be *positive* interactions. Ones that felt congruent, Social, peaceful. So why would my body have such a violent reaction? Always after a response to something i’ve said. \n\nAnd I think I realized something today. It happened again: from the observers window an exchange hardly worth remembering, that I hardly remember now in the temporal, sequential way. But I remember the feeling. And I remembered my body’s feeling. And for the first time I realized, just before this release I’ve been puzzled by—my body was taut. I was tense not in some abstract sense I associated that word with in terms of the self, but literal tension. And when the congruency of the interaction passed, I noticed the same release. But this time there was an A and B to equal the C Catharsis. And I think that means something, I think it means i’m starting to learn, to notice, more. \n\nAll of this still happened. There was no visible change to the eyes of the present moment from the moments it had happened before, but the difference in my mind. An awareness, like slits in the fabric of drapes, to let the light through a little more, shadows replaced with white dust like snow in the streetlight.",

And I was sitting on the couch with my family while they were laughing and I kind of laughed too but there’s this thing that makes me slightly on edge and uncomfortable. Something just feels wrong and I cant describe it. It’s like this fogginess. I’m aware but I guess not aware at the same time? could this be chronic stress? Depression? Anxiety? OCD? Possible ptsd? I am not exactly sure what it is I just know I feel it. All of yesterday I had this odd like fear like feeling in my head it like mentally hurt to the point where it almost felt physical but it didn’t? It’s hard to break it down.

Regardless of balance, we usually have a leading energy. When healed within our leading energy, we tend to find healthy partners who complement us with the opposite leading energy. This creates harmonious relationships where both partners bring out the best in each other. \n\nEdit: In this context feminine isn’t female and masculine isn’t male.. it is not referring to sex!!!!!! It is simply receptive energy vs active energy. We process both even though we all have a leading energy. If you don’t get it this post isn’t meant for you ! \n\nWhen leading feminine energy (receptive energy) is healed, it manifests as:\n\n-Intuitive decision-making, trusting one’s inner voice.\n-Nurturing others while maintaining healthy boundaries.\n-Empathy and deep emotional intelligence.\n-Creativity and a nurturing presence that inspires.\n-Patience and a sense of calm in chaos.\n\nWhen unhealed, it might appear as:\n\n-Overly passive or indecisive.\n-Codependent behaviors, lacking boundaries.\n-Emotional overwhelm or instability.\n-Difficulty asserting oneself or seeking validation externally.\n\nFor leading masculine energy (active energy), when healed, it shows as:\n\n-Confident and assertive in decision-making.\n-Protective in a supportive, empowering way.\n-Decisive, with clear direction and purpose.\n-Logical and strategic thinking, balanced with empathy.\n-Providing stability and structure.\n\nWhen unhealed, it can manifest as:\n\n-Aggression or dominance.\n-Emotional detachment or repression.\n-Controlling or rigid behaviors.\n-Overemphasis on logic, dismissing emotions.\n\nI am a leading feminine 37yr very Masculine presenting gay male.. Healing has been a journey, but understanding this has truly made me embrace myself in a way I can’t ever explane. It is important we understand energy has nothing to do with sexuality, gender, or how people present.. Leading Energy has everything todo with our purpose on earth! Our leading energy helps us identify how we contribute to humanity naturally.. Hope this helps!",

    "text": "is suffocation while meditating a problem? Recently, i have started meditating, so when i sit and try to focus on the natural breath, i feel like my body gives me full control over my breath then i have to breathe intentionally, but my intention is just to observe the natural flow of breath and feel the air going in and out of my nostrils, but i can't do that because of the sense of control, if i do i feel suffocation and then i have to breathe, it became like two tasks at time.\n\nOnce i tried not to take control or if i had control i didn't breathe and ignored when i felt suffocated, then i realized that the breath is going on slowly, not deep but going on and then finally i realized that the sense of control is an illusion, it was peaceful experience of 5 to 10 sec but also one time experience, now again when i meditate i have to breathe intentionally otherwise i feel same suffocation.\n\nis anyone experienced same before or have any solution? or is it even a problem?",

    "text": "I've Been On a Mindfulness Journey for the Past 3 Years. Here's a Small List of the Spotify Resources That I've Found Useful Hey all, the title kind of says it all, but I wanted to pass along a list of resources I've been using over the past few years. I feel like there is so much good stuff on Spotify and it's overlooked as a resource, so I wanted to share some of my favorite finds \n\nMeditations:\n\n1. [The Honest Guys](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6n47s4smWR5T6mZnvHWv7V?si=jk0EEvnqSCeyzLTwjtv__g) \\- Great guided meditations. Love their voices as well, super soothing\n\n2. [Dr. Ramdesh](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ju4fPXUwjpcaV8aocO8R4?si=ZZc7hmGqSRqiI7wbWzKEJg) \\- Her sleep meditation is my go-to\n\n3. [Jess Shepherd](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0tb8jNmVT0pAeMX72rbK0q?si=e48eLkKoT_uXuJ56-fMOpQ) \\- Perfect meditations for self love\n\nPlaylists:\n\n1. [Peaceful Piano Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sRYWF8QV9nHjma4DLrRkB?si=e417603ce8914448) \\- I love classical music, so I find this playlist perfect for helping calm my mind and I find the piano music beautiful. \n\n2. [Meditation Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZqd5JICZI0u?si=92424d62845a44d5) \\- This is the Spotify generated meditation playlist. It's updated fairly regularly and is usually pretty good, though it does lean towards more electronic sounds. \n\nPodcasts: \n\n1. [Dualistic Unity](https://open.spotify.com/show/1RIRznCTPeqShuNhtWsfCj?si=28b00dbea2a34b45) \\- Super interesting, I love the mix between the practical conversations and the more philosophical ones. \n\n2. [Being Well ](https://open.spotify.com/show/5d87ZU1XY0fpdYNSEwXLVQ?si=0ab31bc171b8405c) \\- I found this podcast on this sub, and it's been one of my favorites. This podcast does the perfect job of introducing concepts that can be easily introduced in your day to day life.\n\n3. [How to Train a Happy Mind](https://open.spotify.com/show/2LZPT1To5ziuPPbEVDtVhZ?si=c5eec6ec7c794467) \\- Another great podcast option. It's a nice blend between the interview-like podcast format and with some guided meditations sprinkled in. This podcast discusses a lot of Buddhist concepts which I find interesting\n\n4. [Making Sense with Sam Harris](https://open.spotify.com/show/5rgumWEx4FsqIY8e1wJNAk?si=e616ba9f546248bf) \\- I know a lot of people on this sub love him. I enjoy this show, but I have some complicated feelings on Sam Harris that I can leave for a different post :)\n\n  \nHope this helps! Let me know if there are any other resources I should try out",

I couldn't handle my quite moments without peeping into the phone.\n\nI decided to give dopamine reset a shot. not perfect but better than anything else i have tried so far. here is what worked for me:  \n30-Day Detox: Cut my screen time in half over two weeks. Didn’t go cold turkey but set strict limits for social media and distractions.\n\nRedirect Habits: Replaced phone time with taking a walk outside. This was tough at first but effective.\n\nStrict App Blocking: Made mornings and evenings completely avoiding my phone. This cleared my mind than i had thought.\n\nRelearn Boredom: Realized boredom isn’t that much bad, it’s where the best ideas and calm moments come from. I do love this now.\n\nAfter about 3 months later, I’m now more focused, calm, and present. I still slip sometimes, but overall, it’s about taking control of my mind.",

I am curious if more people have experienced the same benefits, and maybe more things. I spend 10-15 minutes every morning on the bus usually, writing down things I am grateful for. So far I have noticed the following benefits:\n\n* I am more mindful - it is easier to stay present for me, also in social interactions\n* I don't really daydream anymore. I used to daydream quite a bit. I would also wish that I was somewhere else, or that I had a particular thing. Now I focus more on what I have. When a daydream comes up I snap out of it quickly.\n* I feel more confident and positive. I guess this comes from shifting from focusing on lack and more to having. I am less pessimistic than I was just two weeks ago\n* I experience bliss and contentment more\n* I also feel it has boosted my empathy.\n\n  \nI am sure there are more positive effects that I have forgotten.\n\nI was surprised about confidence but I think it makes sense.",

    "text": "The Art of Being Nobody: Embracing Learning, Failure, and Growth Hello, I am nobody and always will be {the beauty of everything}. I've lived a reasonable life—giving my all, failing, missing opportunities, and enjoying my share of success. Yet none of these experiences have stopped me from chasing the life I truly desire. For the longest time, I struggled to pinpoint that desire and ended up spending my days helping others solve their problems.\n\nGrowing up, I was often overlooked—not because I had issues, but because I wasn’t the one demanding/needing attention. That experience taught me to look at the bigger picture, and eventually, I realized something important: most people aren’t truly trying to change themselves. We keep doing the same thing, expecting different results, without ever breaking the cycle.\n\nToday, I want to share some nuggets of wisdom I've gathered along this unpredictable journey. These insights have shaped my reality, forcing me to reinvent myself time and again. With persistence, I've learned not only to embrace change but also to find joy in it.\n\nI’m excited to introduce my first curation: [**MIND.me**](https://www.beto.group/mind.me#mind.me). At its core, this curation reminds us that our reality is crafted by how we perceive and feed our minds. Through a curated array of evocative visuals, complemented by brief video snippets, I invite you to see how a well-organized mind can align your entire being—your body, emotions, and energies—in a way that makes even the wildest dreams possible.\n\nThe website is a garden of my thoughts—a space where I explore and archive the ideas that help me navigate life. It’s not perfect, but it works for me, and I hope it inspires you too. If you feel like diving deeper, go ahead—explore at your own pace, even if it feels like getting lost sometimes. Sharing and reflecting on these insights is a journey in itself, one that allows me to understand these concepts better and, hopefully, to present them in a way that resonates with you.\n\nMy mission now is to travel, explore the world, and share the wisdom I uncover along the way. So, I encourage you to remain open-minded and curious. Keep learning, because there's always something new to discover, and keep trying, because there’s always a different approach you haven’t considered. Remember, anything is possible if you're willing to explore and learn.\n\nWe'll be around... 🫡\n\n— b",

I love gardening and I would love to just live outside as I used to but between the bugs and the snow it's like maybe 2 months of the year where it's really pleasant to be outside. I'm driven inside even when the weather is great because I start panicking from bugs. It used to not bother me so much, but I definitely think my limbic system is in overdrive from long COVID and having a horrible difficult to leave marriage. I've been doing diaphragmatic breathing and that's helped but I would love to conquer my annoyance and freak out with bugs.\n\nJust looking for success stories thanks!",

Why be better when everyone don’t care and only see you as the dude who don’t talk? I don’t want to go back wishing for death and going back to hurt myself but I don’t know what to do. I always hope for a better future for myself where I’m somewhere safe. Where I have people to love me and seen as a human being but it feels so easy to lose hope.",

    "text": "Advice on getting out of my head and simply being I have a desire to get out of my head and stay in the present moment where less thinking and resistance occurs in my experience. However my desire to get out of my head and stop more thoughts from popping up sometimes feels rigid and reeks of even more resistance. It feels like my attention/awareness is just another tool that has been co-opted by my mind as one more way to try and feel better / ease my suffering, and as a result even just trying to shine my awareness or simply just making an effort/intention to be can often arouse resistance in my body, in a similar way that trying to concentrate so intensely visually on something may result in eye strain.\n\n I understand logically that simply being is completely effortless, and that there is no point in \"trying\" to be, you already are. My mind has definitely taken this simple truth and tried to complicate it. The task of trying to sink into my experience of being and understand this directly sometimes results in this rigid, uncomfortable form of resistance, and my mind tells me \"you're not doing this correctly! And you won't be liberated from your suffering until you manage to do it the right way or finally have the correct understanding!\"\n\nSimilarly, trying to face uncomfortable emotions feels like I'm trying to shine a torchlight on it so harshly just to get the emotion to dissolve already and I just can't deny that I am doing this and waiting for the emotion to dissipate to feel peaceful. I find it frustrating because I have followed this path for a few years and have wanted to be liberated for so long, I have heard so much about presence being the key to this yet it seems that trying to \"be\", and the intention to have presence sometimes causes more resistance than if I didn't try to do anything. And if I didn't try to do anything I am not sure if I would even know what to do to break the link between thoughts and the feeling they perpetuate in moments of suffering. The most effective action I have taken so far is to ask myself questions to point myself to the experience of being, such as \"Am I aware?\", but I do find myself repeating this so much and definitely try to do it even more in reaction to feeling upset.\n\n \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",

But what surprised me the most was how it turned my chaotic task management system into something peaceful and intentional. Enter ClickUp and TodoistI’ve recently had an “aha!” moment that I felt compelled to share because it’s completely changed the way I approach productivity—and it all started with mindfulness. Like many here, I’ve been exploring mindfulness to find balance and clarity in my life. But what surprised me the most was how it turned my chaotic task management system into something peaceful and intentional. Enter ClickUp and Todoist.\n\n**Mindfulness Meets Task Management**\n\nOne thing I learned through mindfulness is being present with one task rather than juggling 30 ideas in my head. However, turning that concept into practice wasn’t easy when my to-do list felt endless and overwhelming. That’s when I decided to try task management tools like ClickUp and Todoist to help me “declutter” my mind and focus on the now.\n\n**My Experience with ClickUp and Todoist**\n\n• ClickUp: At first, I was hesitant because it seemed so complex. But as I started customizing it for my workflow, it became a mindfulness tool in itself. I could visualize my priorities clearly and stop stressing over forgetting something. It allowed me to focus on today’s tasks instead of getting distracted by the bigger picture.\n\n• Todoist: On the other hand, Todoist brought simplicity and ease into my day. Its clean design made task creation almost meditative. I especially loved using it on hectic days where I couldn’t handle complexity—it’s like journaling but for my tasks.\n\n**The Psychological Shift**\n\nInspired by Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, I realized that too much mental overload pushes us into hasty, stress-driven decisions (System 1 thinking). By aligning with mindful principles, I was able to fully embrace System 2—the slower, more deliberate thought process. Setting intentions with these platforms let me use that calm, intentional energy to stay focused on the present task instead of spiraling into a flood of stress.\n\n**My Go-To Resource**\n\nMindfulness taught me the value of balance, and finding a task management system gave me the tools to achieve it. If you’ve felt the same chaos and want a deeper dive into these tools, I’ve written a personal guide outlining ClickUp vs. Todoist and how I adopted them into my practice: [ClickUp vs. Todoist for Teams](https://baizaar.tools/clickup-vs-todoist-for-teams/).\n\n What practices or tools have worked for you? I’d love to hear your tips, especially from others striving to balance organization with inner calm...",

    "text": "How watching sunrises and sunsets helped me reconnect with my body, mind—and even my skin I’ve been practicing mindfulness for years, but recently something clicked on a deeper level. I started watching sunrises and sunsets regularly—not just as a visual treat, but as a form of meditative presence. No phone, no rush, just stillness.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how these quiet moments began improving not just my mental clarity, but also how I felt in my body. That warm glow we get from the sun during these hours? Turns out, it’s full of infrared light—which has actual regenerative effects on the skin. There’s a study from *Yonsei Medical Journal* showing before-and-after skin results from infrared exposure (search: “Effects of Infrared Radiation on Skin Photo-Aging and Pigmentation”).\n\nSo it got me contemplating—how often do we chase complicated solutions for well-being, when some of the most healing tools are built into nature itself? The less I try, the more I can be. The more I witness, the less I struggle.\n\nThis led me to create a **short cinematic/ immersive film** that blends mindfulness, nature, infrared science and original music I composed. It's 9 minutes long, with zero fluff—just the atmosphere, footage from lakes and sunsets/sunrises around Europe and reflections on why we’ve disconnected from this daily healing ritual.\n\nI’m not selling anything. Just sharing something I poured my heart into, hoping it might resonate with others on a similar path of self-care and reconnection. If you're curious or want to watch the video, feel free to ask—happy to share the link.\n\n🌅✨",

I had no anxieties, no depression, or any worries, despite having  a lot of personal shit going on at home. I always got a bit paranoid when I started smoking but that was because it was shit weed and I was only just getting used to it. I then started smoking cigs and for some reason weed got suddenly better as well. \nAbout two years ago i stopped for a while to focus on my a levels. Then I smoked again, only to then green out and think too much about the bigger picture of life. Nowadays that’s all I think about. I look to the sky and I get shivers, thinking about death. The unavoidable feeling that there’s no certainty and I can’t do anything to change. I understand that I can’t change and that I should just live, but for me it just scares me. I never had this problem though when I was smoking though, both cigs and weed. I was carefree. Now if I smoke I prang about everything. Im looking to take meds for my anxiety so I’m hoping that they help me fall in love with weed again and forget about drinking and pills/powders because I never originally wanted to drink or do drugs, just smoke pot. I get that people will say I shouldn’t smoke anymore and it’s best I just give it up, but all of my friends smoke and it’s just healthier. I really want to smoke again and I need to know if meds can help me fall in love with it like I was a few years ago.",

I really like listening to Ram Dass lectures on Spotify and as a retired psychiatrist he explains that the answer to many traumas is not to over-process them and dig deeper, but to simply let them go - accept that it happened, love yourself anyway, and be in the present rather than running from it. \n\nI guess - and maybe I misunderstand his teaching - I’m worried about digging things up and learning practices that will encourage me to self-pity and look at my problems as something to fix rather than something to renounce.

    "text": "Your Life is a Mirror of Your Identity (think about it) To build on last week’s discussion - I've been exploring a pretty interesting perspective on mindfulness and identity that's shifted the way I approach personal growth. Most mindfulness discussions usually revolve around being present, observing your thoughts without attachment, and finding stillness. While that's definitely valuable, I've continued to think there's another dimension that's just as important, but often overlooked: our underlying self-concept and identity. \n\nI've realized that the quiet story we hold about ourselves—the silent narrative we live by—might actually be the biggest reason why we stay stuck. It's not just the conscious thoughts we observe in meditation or daily life, but the deeper beliefs we rarely question about who we fundamentally think we are. These beliefs shape everything: our posture, energy, actions, decisions, and even our subconscious reactions. And yet, for many of us, this internal identity isn't something we've ever consciously chosen—it's something we've inherited from experiences, setbacks, or other people's expectations.\n\nHere's why this matters: I used to think that simply repeating positive affirmations or trying to \"think positively\" was enough to make meaningful change. But often, I noticed a strange internal resistance, a kind of dissonance between what I was consciously affirming and what I subconsciously believed about myself. My body language, energy, and subtle behaviors kept reverting back to old patterns. It was frustrating, and I couldn't figure out why.\n\nThe breakthrough for me was understanding that our identity isn't fixed or permanent, it's constantly being written, whether we're aware of it or not. **True mindfulness, then, isn't just noticing thoughts; it's becoming deeply aware of this inner identity and consciously choosing to shift it. It’s about becoming aware of the source.**\n\nOur internal identity shapes our reality, which means it’s important to recognize when our self-image is silently sabotaging our growth, and most importantly, how to genuinely rewrite it. So, I thought I'd share this one below too, in case it's helpful for anyone else exploring this angle of mindfulness and personal growth. My only hope is that this type of conversation at least gets you to question yourself and your inner thoughts in a good way. That’s where real change happens. \n\n[https://youtu.be/HEKoBL1vRfs](https://youtu.be/HEKoBL1vRfs) \n\nI'm curious about your experiences - have you ever felt your self-image or subconscious beliefs holding you back? If you've tried shifting your identity consciously, what worked for you? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

Now, I am learning not to dismiss or abandon my needs, not to silence my naturally arising emotions, but to meet them with compassion and loving kindness. For too long, I had bullied the wounded parts of myself—not because others did once I became an adult, but because I had internalized a destructive pattern. A silent tormentor in my mind whispered: If you feel this, you are not strong enough, not good enough, not worthy of love.\n\nI know it wasn’t intentional. Those around me were protecting themselves from their own pain as they watched mine. But it’s time to break the cycle. To stop this madness.

They need us to process the pain we’ve long ignored, resisted, and buried in the dungeons of our subconscious.\n\nWhen we meet these shadows with care, they transform. They release the power they’ve been holding back—our creativity, strength, resilience. Through the ugly truths we uncover about ourselves, they show us the path to freedom.\n\nImagine your shadow as your closest friend or a child longing for love, an ally guiding you toward wholeness, a source of strength leading you to awakening. Embrace it with kindness.\n\n💛\n\n©️ N. Z. Kaminsky",

I've been reading about it and focuses on recognizing ones own contribution, but I was targeted for years.  \n\nFor some better insight: \nI was bullied by a group of people for 5 years. I ended up very unwell unable to work etc. I did nothing at all wrong here I was a pure victim in it all. While this happened my bestfriend who has borderline pd and I had many conflicts we would spend 2 years communicating through a third person via fb. The above consumed me it was very toxic. I acknowledge my wrongdoing in this relationship. Multiple times each day I think of those above and feel intense anger. I replay things in my head all the time. I feel regret that I didn't cut ties sooner. This was years ago. I can't move on. I did nothing with my life for 5 years. I could've spent more time with my young son aswell. My question is I need to move forward but 10 years on I am in the same headspace.",

    "text": "My Life as of late (I'd really love to dialogue) It's 9:54 PM on a Sunday, and as I sit here, I seriously have no idea what's going on in my life right now. I went for a walk and realized something big: I've been letting my brain, *not me*, dictate my entire life. I don't think I've ever made the distinction between my brain and myself until now — and it's starting to become clearer.\n\nIt feels like my brain has been working against me day in and day out for **years**, not days. *Years*. And now I'm like, wow — how did I even survive this long like that?\n\nI honestly don’t know who or what I am anymore. I’ve gone through a lot, I think, but it’s all a blur. College flew by. I couldn’t tell you much about what happened with friends, socially, anything — because I’ve been numb through all of it. It feels like all I have to show for my 20+ years on this planet is a brain that’s constantly scanning for threats.\n\nIt doesn’t feel fair — but life itself isn’t fair. Ever. The only thing I know is that *I am*. But even that doesn’t feel real most days. Like yes, in reality I exist, but the way my life has felt, I haven’t truly *been here* for most of it.\n\nThe dissociation has been so strong that I honestly couldn’t tell you things most people know about themselves without hesitation. My bank account balance, my GPA, how many friends I have, my credit score, even my life plan — I don’t know. Because I’ve been so wrapped up in my own mind — a slave to this loop, this thought, this fear — that’s been running the show for as long as I can remember.\n\nEven finance — something I thought was my purpose — feels like a front. Like I *thought* it meant something to me, but if I’m honest, I don’t feel connected to it at all. I respect the “act in spite of fear” mindset, and I’ve lived by that for a while, but I still don’t know what reality even is.\n\nI’ve basically been living in my own world for the past 6 years. That’s the best way I can describe it. Every conversation, every relationship, every single second of every day has been full of anxiety, obsession, and fear. And what’s wild is — it doesn’t even feel like *I’ve* been the one obsessing. It feels like something else has hijacked me, and I’ve been trying to fight it off without even knowing how.\n\nThis life hasn’t felt real, man. None of it. I don’t know what to do. It’s been this constant fog of anxiety, fear, and depression — *over nothing*. Like literal air. But that’s been my entire life. My entire life has been fear and obsession over \"looking\" — this constant mental checking, awareness, control — and I’ve been doing it for 22 years. That’s just wild to even type out.\n\nAnd even now, typing this doesn’t feel real. *Nothing* I do or feel has felt real. I’ve been completely dissociated from reality for most of my life. I think I’ve even underplayed just how bad it’s been — because this *has* been my entire focus. It’s all I think about. And no one seems to care — or at least it feels like no one does.\n\nI keep trying to push through it, telling myself to move, to walk, to do something. But then I get stuck again. Like what would life even look like without constantly obsessing over something that I *can’t fix*? Something that has *no solution*?\n\nSometimes I feel like I haven’t experienced even the *basic range* of human emotions. The cold, the warmth, affection, touch, joy. Things people take for granted every day — like going out, or the feeling of a blanket, or just sitting still and noticing time passing — I’ve been blind to it all. Interactions don’t feel real. It’s all just been anxiety, depression, OCD.\n\nI lived for three months in Pittsburgh — a whole city — by myself, and I feel like I have *nothing* to show for it. No memories. No true experiences. But even during that trip, there was this one moment — a very real moment — where I *felt* alive. And that stays with me.\n\nEven typing this now… it’s like I’m writing it to try to feel alive again.\n\nAnd if I do post this, I just want to say thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it. I think it’s a wise idea for me to post it — not to get pity or attention, but to get this shame *out of me* and throw it into the real world. To finally *hear* what other minds think about what I’ve been experiencing.\n\nI’m honestly grateful that I’m facing all this now — at this inflection point in my life where I’m about to step into a phase where I’ll need to take care of myself and others. I’m 22, but I feel like I’m still frozen in my sophomore year of high school — when everything first hit the fan.\n\nRereading this before posting, I just want to say: this actually *is* helping. Just getting it out. Making it real. So, again, thank you for being here.",

And I tend to have a bad habit of not confronting my emotions till I'm overwhelmed with baggage.\n\nIve been learning about meditation throughout the years, lots of it inspired by readings from Eckhart Tolle whom I am grateful for.\n\nI try to be mindful and present, by observing my thoughts and let it pass, telling myself I am not my thoughts. and try to let go of things I no longer have control over. when I do, it tends to alleviate my pain a bit, like I can breath again.\n\nhowever I find that I almost get a \"rebound\" effect after. where those negative feelings come back even stronger the moment I'm not being mindful. as If I was surpessing those emotions during my mindfulness exercises.\n\nI guess my question is: is this normal? am I perhaps approaching mindfulness/meditation the wrong way?\n\nis it maybe necessary to feel the pain fully to properly process negative emotions, and move on from past chapters of life? or do I just keep observing them for relief, and ride it out the suppressed pain when It comes back.\n\nI would really love to gain some insight on my best course of action for my path of healing, and make peace with my suffering.",

Try the 3-2-1 Grounding Technique a simple, fast method to bring your focus back to the present and clear your mind. Imagine this: When you're feeling stressed, pause for a moment and engage your senses with these steps:\n\nLook Around: Identify three things you can see. It could be anything—a picture, a plant, or even your own hands. Feel Your Surroundings: Notice two things you can touch. Feel the texture of your chair, the fabric of your clothes, or the coolness of your phone.\n\nListen In: Focus on one thing you can hear. It might be the sound of birds outside, a distant hum, or simply your own steady breathing. By deliberately engaging your senses, you pull your mind away from its habitual negative loops and anchor yourself in the now. This quick reset can make a huge difference in how you handle stress and regain control.\n\nGive it a try the next time you're feeling overwhelmed, and drop a comment below with your experience.",

Studies show that mindfulness meditation can reshape your brain, increasing gray matter density in areas linked to emotional regulation, memory, and self-awareness. It reduces activity in the stress-inducing amygdala while strengthening connections to the prefrontal cortex, helping you manage emotions and make better decisions.\nNot a fan of traditional meditation? Try creative mindfulness exercises like sensory storytelling, mindful gardening, or soundscape meditation to cultivate presence and emotional resilience. Whether you’re seeking stress relief or greater self-awareness, mindfulness can transform your mental clarity and well-being.\n\nCurious about the science behind mindfulness and how you can integrate it into your life?

    "text": "Does nature influence creativity in humans? Does creativity by humans involves iterative process where imitation, replication, memories and imagination combined and recombined to create something new or  nature influencing creativity in human beings?\n\nWhile doing window shopping  I was attracted by these round shaped plastic flowers in white yellow colours looking unique in its structure and style. Though much against buying plastic, that day I decided to take them home out of curiosity and wondering the creativity & imagination behind the design. \n\nFew days ago adding to my surprise, similar kind of blooms popped up from Onion shoots in my garden making a Woowww moment for me. \n\nThen I remembered Sadhguru speaking about creativity. “Everything that can be created has already been done in creation. We are clever craftsmen at the most. If you define the word ‘creativity’ as really creating something- whether you make a movie, paint something, build a building, speak or whatever else - this is not really creative- it is clear imitation. Because we have paid attention to different aspects of life, we are able to imitate or replicate the same in ways that others have not thought possible. “\n\nOur perception and attention makes powerful\nimpact on our memory and creativity. Imagination, personal experiences and memories all contribute to the complex and multifaceted nature of creativity.",

Or perhaps, have you ever wished to be invisible, to slip through life without being seen, heard, or touched by others?\n\nWhat is it that makes us feel the need to hide ourselves away from the world? Is it a fear of vulnerability, or perhaps an ingrained belief that something is wrong with how we perceive reality, how we interact with life, or something that would make others judge or reject us?\n\nYet, beneath these fears lies something much deeper—a longing for connection, a desire to be seen. At the heart of this fear of exposure is a dormant need for recognition, validation, and love—not just for our actions, but for the beauty of our inner selves.\n\nMaybe it’s not that we want to hide, but that we’ve been conditioned to believe we must first be “perfect” or “whole” before we can allow ourselves to be truly seen. The truth is, we are all beautifully imperfect, and sometimes, allowing ourselves to be visible, with all our flaws and fears, is the most powerful form of connection we can offer to the world.\n\nThoughts? 🤔",

I’m hoping someone here can relate or offer some insight.\n\nBasically, right before I sleep, I get caught in a weird loop.\n\nWhen I lie down to sleep, I feel the urge to drink water, but not just once. My brain keeps telling me, “Just one more sip and then you’ll feel okay.”\n\nBut that sip never satisfies me. I take another… then another… and it keeps going until I either feel “just right” or get frustrated.\n\nAfter drinking, I start burping — not because of digestive issues, but because my brain keeps saying, “Just one more burp and you’ll be able to sleep.”\n\nIt’s like a little ritual or loop I can’t break. Even if I try to resist, there’s this lingering discomfort like I skipped something, and it won’t let me fully relax.\n\nThis only happens before sleep, and not during the day. I don’t think I have OCD in a full-blown way — no major compulsions outside of this. It just feels like my brain created this loop and now insists on running it.\n\nIt’s annoying and starting to affect how peacefully I sleep. Has anyone experienced anything like this?\nIs this some mild form of compulsion? Anxiety? A sleep-related behavior?\nAnd most importantly — how can I break it?\n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts or advice.",

It’s about being fully present in everything I do, even in the smallest tasks.\n\nHere’s how I started integrating mindfulness into my daily routine:\n\n1. **Mindful Eating**: Instead of rushing through meals, I started paying attention to the flavors, textures, and smells of my food. It’s amazing how much more satisfying eating becomes when I’m truly present.\n2. **Mindful Breathing**: Whenever I feel stressed or overwhelmed, I take a few moments to focus on my breath. Just a few deep breaths can ground me in the present moment and help clear my mind.\n3. **Mindful Walking**: Whether it’s a walk in nature or just walking around the house, I focus on the sensation of each step, the sounds around me, and the rhythm of my movement. It’s a small but powerful way to stay connected to the present.\n4. **Mindful Conversations**: I make a conscious effort to listen fully when speaking with others. This not only helps me understand them better but also helps me feel more connected and less distracted.\n\nI’ve found that these small mindfulness practices make a big difference in my mental clarity and emotional balance. It’s not always easy, but the more I practice, the more natural it becomes.\n\nHow do you incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine?

    "text": "How Practicing Mindfulness Transformed My Project Management System Over the past few years, I've tried everything from meditation apps to hardcore productivity tools in my quest for a balanced, mindful life. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that mindfulness isn't just about sitting silently—it's about integrating calm and clarity into every aspect of your life, including work.\n\nRecently, I found myself struggling to keep my professional tasks aligned with my mindfulness practices. Despite the sea of productivity apps available, I felt overwhelmed rather than focused. That's when I decided to test two of the most acclaimed project management tools, **Todoist** and **ClickUp**, and see how well they fit into a mindful workflow.\n\n# My Mindfulness-Inspired Approach\n\nInspired by the idea of **System 1 and System 2 thinking** from Daniel Kahneman’s *Thinking, Fast and Slow*:\n\n* **System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking)** helped in quickly jotting down tasks or ideas whenever they popped up.\n* **System 2 (slow, deliberate thinking)** was essential for reviewing and organizing these tasks mindfully.\n\n**Todoist** immediately won me over with its simplicity. It allowed me to capture tasks quickly without disrupting my flow—a perfect match for System 1 thinking. Its clean interface meant that I wasn't bombarded with unnecessary information, helping me stay focused and present.\n\nHowever, as my projects grew more complex, I found myself needing more robust features to manage multiple layers of tasks. This is where **ClickUp** excelled. ClickUp’s advanced features like time tracking, customizable views, and automations aligned with my System 2 thinking, allowing me to dive deep into project planning without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n# Integrating Mindfulness with Productivity\n\nI've also been experimenting with integrating mindfulness routines into my project management:\n\n* **Mindful Task Review**: At the end of each day, I spend 10 minutes reviewing tasks in ClickUp, ensuring I've captured everything accurately and prioritizing tasks for the next day.\n* **Scheduled Breaks**: ClickUp’s reminder feature prompts me to take mindful breaks, ensuring I don’t get lost in endless work.\n* **Weekly Reflection**: Using Todoist’s simplicity, I have a “Weekly Reflection” project where I jot down thoughts, progress, and areas where I can improve my mindfulness and productivity balance.\n\n# Practical Tips for a Mindful Workflow:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Use **Todoist** for daily tasks and quick captures.\n2. **Move to Detailed Planning**: Transition to **ClickUp** for complex projects that require detailed planning.\n3. **Schedule Mindful Breaks**: Utilize reminders to take breaks and reconnect with your breathing.\n4. **Daily Reflection**: Spend a few minutes at the end of each day reflecting on your accomplishments and planning mindfully for tomorrow.\n\n# Real-Life Example\n\nTo bring it all together, here's a snapshot of my current workflow:\n\n* **Morning Routine**: Review Todoist for daily tasks while sipping my morning tea, keeping it light and manageable.\n* **Afternoon Deep Dive**: Switch to ClickUp for project planning sessions, using its robust tools to map out client projects and deadlines.\n* **Evening Reflection**: A quick Todoist check for any missed tasks and a 10-minute reflection in ClickUp—often a calming end to a busy day.\n\nExploring these two tools taught me that a mindful approach to productivity isn't just possible—it's profoundly beneficial. If you’re curious about my detailed comparison and analysis of **Todoist vs ClickUp**, check out my [full article here](https://baizaar.tools/todoist-vs-clickup-pricing-showdown/). It dives deeper into the pricing and value of both tools, ultimately guiding you to choose the best fit for a mindfulness-oriented workflow.\n\nThank you for reading. I hope these insights help you blend mindfulness with productivity, allowing you to stay calm, clear, and always focused.",

In this way, emulating mindfulness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It creates a positive feedback loop, until one day, you no longer have to emulate it at all.",

    "text": "Finding Peace in the Pause: My Mindfulness Journey \nHey r/Mindfulness, I’ve been wanting to share how mindfulness has started to shift things for me. A few months back, life felt like a runaway train—work was relentless, my inbox was a nightmare, and I was juggling family stuff that left me drained. I was snapping at people I care about and barely sleeping. Then I stumbled across a podcast about mindfulness, and something clicked. I figured I’d give it a try, even though sitting still sounded like the last thing I had time for.\n\nI started small, just five minutes a day, focusing on my breath. Let me tell you, it was rough at first—my mind was like a hyperactive puppy, chasing every thought about deadlines or what I forgot to do. But I kept at it, using a simple technique where I’d count my breaths to stay anchored. Slowly, I noticed I wasn’t just going through the motions anymore. I’d catch myself in moments of stress—like when a meeting went sideways—and instead of spiraling, I’d take a deep breath and feel this tiny space open up. It’s like I could choose how to respond instead of just reacting.\n\nOne day that really stood out was when I was stuck in traffic, late for an appointment. Normally, I’d be gripping the wheel, muttering under my breath. But this time, I noticed my frustration, took a few slow breaths, and focused on the rhythm of the cars around me. It didn’t fix the delay, but it made me feel less like the world was against me. I actually showed up to that appointment calm, which is a minor miracle for me.\n\nMindfulness has also helped me be more present with people. I used to half-listen to my partner or friends, my mind already jumping to the next thing. Now, I try to really hear them, noticing their tone or the little pauses in what they say. It’s made conversations feel deeper, like I’m actually there.\n\nI’m no expert—some days I skip my practice, and I still get caught up in stress. But even on those days, I’ll try to bring mindfulness into small moments, like feeling the warmth of my coffee mug or listening to the sound of rain. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about giving myself a chance to pause.\n\nI’d love to hear from you all—what’s been your go-to mindfulness practice? Any tips for someone still figuring it out? Thanks for being such a welcoming space to reflect and grow.",

It seems like a one-or-the-other scenario. \n\nPlease give me your thoughts. I’ve been trying to create a diligent practice, but I’m frustrated.",

Usually my mind can't stay quiet and I keep getting lost but for some reasons today after some deep breathing, I felt different, somehow, I felt like I was floating, like I didn't have any feet and in my mind I looked up and it was like I was seeing deep blue sky but when I look around me I saw that I was one of these big ancient Greek Gods Statues.\n\nThe experience was different and I wonder if anyone had something like that.",

    "text": "[Part 2] How I Learned to Let Bad Thoughts Die In the [Part 1 of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1jy0q6l/how_i_learned_to_let_bad_thoughts_die/), we talked about how reacting to a negative thought is like watering a plant - you just help it grow.\n\n**So the solution sounds simple: stop reacting.**\n\nBut the real question is - how?\n\nTo do that, we have to train our mind to listen to us.\n\nOur body listens. If we want to raise a hand, it moves.\n\nBut try asking your mind to sit quietly for just 10 minutes - it won’t. It drifts to the past or leaps into the future.\n\nWe have to become the master of the mind. Right now, most of us are its slaves.\n\nThoughts come, and we react. They pull us in every direction.\n\nBut once we start practicing this mindfulness technique, something shifts.\n\n**We begin to see thoughts like clouds in the sky.**\n\nThey appear. They pass. We don’t follow them. We don’t fight them. We just see them.\n\nThat seeing without reacting - that’s what it means to stop watering the plant. And when you stop reacting to bad thoughts, they lose their strength.\n\nThey still show up, but they don’t stick around. You’ve stopped feeding them.\n\nAnd then something interesting happens: You start creating space in your mind.\n\nThat space is powerful. Because now, you can choose what you want to plant there.\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck in your head or weighed down by thoughts, I’m always happy to share more - or just talk it through.",

    "text": "What makes me so different? I, 20 F have a friend who’s same age as me, as well as similar features. We are both the same race and look alike in some ways, I would say our attractiveness is also the same, but that’s what I’m here to ask you all. We are both in college and recently became friends this school year. My friend will always come up to me talking about different people at our school, sometimes guys, sometimes girls. We gossip about people and it’s fun talking with someone who gets me. She also gets a lot of male validation and attention. She has either been hit up or gone on a date with many of the guys at school, nothing more happened with a lot of them except this one that she is no longer communicating with. She constantly gets asked out in person, asked for her number, or hit up on instagram or snapchat. We are in our second year of college and none of this is abnormal. However, i’m just wondering what’s so bad about me? I would say we look pretty similar and have similar features. We are both studying good in school, have good majors, both fit and conventionally attractive. I am not at all in any way shape or form, trying to shed negative light on my friend, i truly think she is beautiful and I see why she gets so much attention. But sometimes it gets to me. Not that I don’t want her to, but i start to question my looks, my personality, how i am. Am i lower than her? Am i that different that people don’t come up to me or approach me. Now I have maybe a few times had some people come up to me, but not near as much as her and not at all the same level of attractiveness.. or at least most. Maybe the problem is i don’t go to gym or parties that much and that’s where she meets most of them. I really can’t find the answer. Maybe most these people are just looking to HU and she seems like the type? I am really not sure, but it’s bugging me and I hate thinking that I am not enough. I know my time will come but man it gets real difficult at times. \n\nPlease let me know what you think! Again, no hateful comments or negative ideas, truly just curious.",

    "text": "I am my thoughts \"Discussion\" would be a more appropriate flair here, but it wasn't an option so I put \"question.\"\n\nPeople always say \"you are not your thoughts\", but that's not true. Imagine that my thoughts were discarded, and in their place, all of the thoughts and memories of Jack Black (first famous person I thought of) were put into my mind. I would *be* Jack Black. Maybe my physical body didn't perform all of the same actions as his, and maybe my body would look different from his, but I would have the subjective experience of *being* him, and as far as I'm concerned, that's what makes somebody who they are.\n\nA common counterpoint is \"If you are your thoughts, then how can you observe them?\" The answer is simple: another thought is observing the thought, and I am not observing the thought that's observing the thought.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yq7ceuu9zue1.png?width=5632&format=png&auto=webp&s=42efe5ae094b0ce5c15c83a74ed28afa3349819c\n\nHere is a picture of a camera. I might say, \"A camera can't take a picture of itself, so this can't be a camera.\" But the solution is obvious: a second camera was used to take a photo of the first camera. There is no photo of this camera, unless you bring out a third camera. You can do this an infinite number of times, and there will always be one camera that isn't shown because no others are taking a picture of it.\n\nIt's the same with your thoughts. You have a thought. Now, you have a thought about having the thought. Until you have a third thought, you are completely unaware that you are observing a thought. But now, you think \"I am observing a thought\", and this thought observes that you are observing a thought. Failing to have yet another thought that observes the observation, you think \"Aha! *I* am observing a thought, so *I* must be separate from my thoughts!\"\n\nNow, there seems to be an issue here: I have been saying \"you\" this entire time, implying that there is something having the thought. But when I say \"you\", I mean a collection of thoughts that are \"clumped together.\" What I mean by this is that you are a cluster of thoughts that all heavily influence one another. Another person is another cluster of thoughts that influence one another. Should the two of you interact, your thoughts will influence theirs, and their thoughts will influence yours. However, these thoughts have to go through the filters of speech and actions before exerting this influence, so there is a \"membrane\" between your thoughts and theirs. A person is a collection of all of the thoughts inside one of these \"membranes\", so if a thought directly influences another thought without having to be converted through the physical world first, then those two thoughts are part of a single person. You may follow the thread, first finding two thoughts that are linked together, then finding the other thoughts that those two thoughts are linked to, and so on and so forth, until you have found most or all of the thoughts that comprise a single person.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? (Pun absolutely intended)",

How do I stay present when the future (a future that I understand may never even happen, but at the moment seems likely) is exciting in a positive way?

In the past, I’ve found some videos I’ve remembered and even if I didn’t I wouldn’t care. But recently, I’ve dwelled on it to the point where my mind would race and I’d lose sleep from then thinking about wanting to sleep and being unable to since my mind was on a loop from said topic. I was able to snap out of it the first time and get back to great sleep (over a week ago), but it happened again last night from remembering something else and I was kept awake.

Grief never truly goes away, but we learn to adapt to its presence while living our lives, because we’re still here, and that’s something worth treasuring.\n\nIf you’ve lost someone recently, know that the acute, unbearable pain will loosen its grip if you allow it to flow through you freely. Time doesn’t heal—it’s the allowance of what is that brings healing.\n\nBut there's also something healing, even nurturing, about grieving a parent.\nWhen it happens, we’re thrown into a hurricane of regrets, unhealed wounds, and the verdict of never having closure. We don’t just mourn the person — we mourn our childhood that can’t be rewritten, the missed opportunities, and all the pain once buried in silence that now rises, demanding to be felt.\n\nIt’s not just loss. It’s a transition.\nWe step into a new era — one where we become the only adult left in the room, and the only parent that remains is the one we must become to ourselves.\n\nN. Z.

Every day I usually spend my evenings scrolling through my camera roll, google photos, old TikTok’s, just about anything from my past. I mean this is a DAILY occurrence and it started from a pretty young age. On our family computer we had a cloud full of every single photo we’ve taken like yk what I’m talking about, and from as long as I remember I would just always look through them, every night. I feel like I am just psychoanalyzing my life. When I do these like “daily look backs” I’m not always met with sadness but usually like a range of emotions, almost like I’m trying to relive the past and how I felt in that time. It’s like I miss these “eras” of myself and I’ll just hyperfixate on who I used to be, and analyze what my life was like at that point and the kind of person I was. It’s not even like I hate the person I am now, I don’t think I’ve ever been happier with who I am. \nNot to bring random shit up, but I also wonder if this is somehow trauma related? My mom had a hemorrhagic stroke when I was 7 that caused her to be comatose then eventually permanently disabled. She has very limited cognitive ability and that change in my life was so hard for me at such a young age - I don’t think I’ve still even fully dealt with it. Being older now, (and by obsessively looking back into my past) I can reflect on the fact that when it happened I kind of just pretended it didn’t. My older sister was very depressed when it happened, and was for an extremely long time, and my younger sister was too young to process it at the time but has now resorted to anger as she has grown up and been fully able to deal with it. I wasn’t either of those, not angry nor sad. I just continued being me and I wonder if because I never processed it, I am just constantly looking back at the way things were, and just wish that they could be like that again - not even just my life before my moms stroke, but I “wish things could be like that again” for every part in my life. Instead of really focusing on my reality I spent (and still spend) way too much in my head and I think I’ve just been faded from reality a bit. Like I am not living in the present but I am stuck in the past, just analyzing my own existence. I just want to allow myself to stop always looking back and to try and remain in the present. I just want a reason for why I’m constantly yearning for the past.",

Buddhist monk Ajahn Sona teaches Samadhi practice - a state of positive emotion and bliss greater than all worldly pleasures. He said \"Western Mindfulness practitioners have a fetish for pain\" because most mindfulness advice has nothing to do with development of ecstatic or blissful experiences. They just advice to be non-judgemental to mental pain.\n\nMeanwhile Samadhi is pleasurable to both body and mind and it is a direct experience of the state of mind that Buddha himself possessed. Buddhist scriptures define Buddha as having found ultimate bliss and drunk the 'water of immortality'.\n\nHe advises us to expect more and not be satisfied with less. He also teaches a form of mindfulness that according to him grants preliminary joy.",

    "text": "Be Mindful Of Self-Fulfilling Prophecies **Most people don't realize their life isn't random or happening to them, but that it's happening because of them.** \n\nYour thoughts create loops and those loops subtly become your personality, your habits, your identity, and eventually your entire world.\n\nIt's wild how often we try to \"fix\" the outer world without even questioning the inner mindset that built it.\n\nYou can switch jobs, move cities, change relationships... But if you're still operating from the same mental blueprint, the same emotional habits and self-concept will just recreate similar circumstances over and over.\n\nYour subconscious doesn’t take a liking to anything that contradicts what it already believes to be true. It would rather be consistent than correct (think about what that means to you). \n\nThat's why some unconsciously sabotage the things they say they want, just to be in familiar territory. It’s a comforting state, but not necessarily conducive to personal growth. \n\nPositive affirmations are great, but not the only thing. You will never be “ready” unless you start. You can watch 20 more podcasts and read 10 more books, but then again, it’s not the only thing.  \n\nWhat works is being the version of yourself you haven't fully become yet, before it feels “natural”. That's what rewires the nervous system. That's how you shift belief.\n\nI’m working on a project regarding these things, this one in particular is about how we all create self-fulfilling prophecies for ourselves, and how we can interrupt that habit and reshape our life to reflect a new one.\n\nIf you want something deeper but still grounded, I think you'll get a lot from it. \n\nLet me know if you think I'm wrong or if you agree, I'm always up for a conversation. I hope you find value in what I've put here. \n\n [Why You Keep Attracting the Same Life](https://youtu.be/-hjRZEj4_V4)\n\nI think this is one of the most important concepts we rarely talk about. Anyways, i hope you enjoy your Wednesday! This is usually the time when we get a bit tired from the week, so make sure to come back to center, come back to yourself on this day. \n\nThanks all!",

    "text": "Not a Love Story: The Inner Alchemy of Snow White Not a Love Story: The Inner Alchemy of Snow White\n\nI think Disney, especially in their recent adaptations of Snow White, completely missed the mark. As if they couldn’t consult with specialists who understand the deep symbolic layers of ancient tales.\n\nDid you know that in psychoanalytical and symbolic interpretations (Jungian) —  the wicked stepmother in the original Snow White is seen as a representation of Snow White’s shadow self?\n\nIn the Grimms’ version, Snow White is born with skin \"as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony.\" These three colours: white, red, and black carry deep symbolic meaning. Together, they represent the fullness of the feminine psyche:\n\n🤍White symbolizes innocence, purity, and passivity.\n\n❤️Red evokes passion, desire, blood, life force, and sexuality.\n\n🖤Black stands for mystery, depth, unconsciousness, and the shadow.\n\nBut the moment Snow White enters the world, she clings only to her whiteness — her obedience, her innocence, her light. The red and black aspects of her being, the parts linked to instinct, desire, power, and emotional intensity, are repressed, cast out, and projected outward. Over time, these rejected aspects crystallize into the figure of the stepmother: the “evil” woman, consumed by envy, isolated, misunderstood, and starved for love.\n\nThis shadow self, the stepmother, is not inherently evil, but fragmented. She longs to be seen, accepted, and integrated. She too seeks love and validation, turning to the mirror, the mother-archetype, pleading for reassurance of her worth and beauty. But when love is denied, she grows increasingly furious and destructive — not to destroy Snow White per se, but to eliminate the unbearable contrast between them.\n\nHer attacks are symbolic, psychological:\n\n1. The laces (corset strings) — represent constriction, the pressure to conform to ideals of self worth , goodness and societal norms. The stepmother tightens the laces until Snow White nearly dies, symbolizing the way a woman might feel suffocated by expectations of perfection, docility, or appearance. She’s “bound” by roles and identities that do not allow the fullness of self to exist. \n\n2. The poisoned comb, placed in Snow White’s hair, represents manipulated thoughts, toxic beliefs, or harmful influences that settle in the mind. Hair often symbolizes identity, sensuality, and intuition. By poisoning this space, the stepmother infects Snow White’s inner narrative, mirroring how intrusive, critical, or internalized voices can corrupt a pure sense of self, her inner clarity. \n\n3. The poisoned apple is offered by the shadow self, disguised as a kind, old woman. Temptation often comes in familiar, even comforting, forms. And the most dangerous illusions are the ones we don’t question.\n\nThe apple is split as a symbol of duality: one side pure, the other poisoned. It offers a choice between unconscious innocence and awakened maturity. To remain a child… or to grow?\n\nWhen Snow White bites the apple, she undergoes a symbolic death. Her old, fragmented self must fall away. This moment mirrors depression — a descent, a chrysalis phase in the transformation of the soul.\n\nBut this death is necessary. It allows space to grieve what was, and to accept what is. In surrender, there is healing. Integration. Awakening.\n\nThe stepmother’s attacks are the shadow’s cry for integration. Until Snow White reclaims her red and black—until she sees the stepmother not as “other” but as part of herself — she remains unconscious, passive, asleep.\n\nThis tale, then, becomes a powerful metaphor for inner wholeness. True transformation begins not with banishing the stepmother, but with embracing the shadow, healing the split, and honouring all aspects as parts of one — innocence and desire, light and darkness.\n\nAnd the prince? It’s not about a guy saving the day! Not at all! He represents her animus, the masculine energy within her own psyche.\n\nN. Z. Kaminsky 💛",

    "text": "What Really Happens to Your Brain When You Meditate Every Day? I do part-time research in mindfulness, and coming from an engineering and research background, I naturally lean on science to guide my understanding. In my research I sometimes come across these wonderful studies, and wonder why they are not more popular. Here's one of them (sorry about some of the scientific jargons used in the post):\n\n  \nA study published in Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, titled “Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density”, explored how an 8-week mindfulness program physically changed the brain structure.\n\nThe researchers recruited 16 participants aged 25–55, all without prior meditation experience, and enrolled them in a structured 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. The participants meditated for around 27 minutes per day and attended weekly 2.5-hour sessions, which included:\n\n* Body Scan Meditation – tuning into bodily sensations from head to toe\n* Mindful Yoga – gentle stretches combined with present-moment awareness\n* Sitting Meditation – focusing on the breath, sounds, or internal sensations\n\nThey used MRI scans to measure the brain structure before and after the program, comparing the results to a control group that didn’t practice mindfulness.\n\nThe findings were pretty remarkable!\n\n**Key Brain Changes Observed:**\n\n* Gray matter increased in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and managing emotions. This is particularly important because people with chronic stress, anxiety, or depression often show reduced volume here. This increase leads to stronger memory, improved emotional balance, and greater resilience to stress.\n* The Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) showed growth, which helps regulate self-awareness and mind-wandering. Participants who meditated showed growth in this area, while those in the control group actually experienced a decline. This leads to better attention control and the ability to stay present with tasks.\n* Although the cerebellum is traditionally associated with movement, the study found that it also grew in response to meditation. Which means, better regulation of thoughts and emotions, improved cognitive coordination.\n\n**Why did this happen?**\n\nAs per current understanding these changes are attributed to **neuroplasticity** — the brain’s ability to adapt and rewire itself based on repeated experiences. When you consistently train attention and awareness through mindfulness, you reinforce neural pathways that support emotional regulation, concentration, and empathy.\n\n  \nIt feels like a those click bait ad selling wonder medicine, but that's what science found to be the benefits of mindfulness\n\n* Reduced anxiety and stress\n* Improved decision-making\n* Sharper focus and memory\n* Better emotional awareness\n\nIf you’re curious about the science of mindfulness or want more research-backed insights like this, I’d be happy to share what I come across.",

After all, there’s no promise of an afterlife, and even if such a concept exists, who knows if it would be relevant to our human needs?\n\nWhat if we tried instead to accept this fear as something natural and deserving of its own existence, and simply let it be?\nIt’s hard, I know. But fighting our feelings is futile. They have their own rhythm and their own nature, beyond our comprehension, let alone our control.\n\nI would suggest sitting with the fear, allowing it to flow through you. At first, it will feel unbearable. So tiny doses, a few minutes at a time, can make it easier to bear. Don’t push it, but also don’t try to escape or transcend it. I believe this is a big part of being human: our attachments to what matters, especially our connections with others. This is the primal need of any living being with a decent amount of consciousness — to feel connected.\n\nGoenka (the vipassana teacher) spoke of a very advanced stage of self-awareness, one that may be nearly impossible to reach in a single lifetime, or even in many. I think it would be cruel to demand such progress from ourselves. But at the same time, fighting our fears brings unnecessary tension, and that only intensifies the experience of fear itself.\n\nN.

In [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1jz4nmz/part_2_how_i_learned_to_let_bad_thoughts_die/), we learned to see thoughts as clouds - just passing by, not something we have to chase or fight.\n\nToday, I want to talk about two ideas that helped me go even deeper: **equanimity and impermanence.**\n\nEquanimity means staying calm and balanced no matter what kind of thought shows up - positive or negative. It’s not about suppressing emotions. It’s about observing everything with a steady heart. Whether it’s anger, joy, fear, or excitement - **equanimity is choosing not to be shaken.**\n\nAnd **impermanence reminds us that nothing stays forever**. Every thought, every emotion, every high and low - it all passes.\n\nWhen you hold both of these in mind, something powerful happens.\n\nA difficult thought comes? You notice it. You stay calm. And you remind yourself: This will pass.\n\nYou don’t resist it. You don’t cling to it. You just see it - then let it go.\n\nThat calm awareness is what allows old patterns to fade. It’s what creates peace, even when the mind is noisy.\n\nSo if your thoughts feel heavy right now, try sitting with them - not to fix them, not to fight them. Just to see them, with a gentle reminder:\n\n**This is temporary. I don’t have to react. I can stay still.**\n\nI’m starting a free weekly online meetup to go deeper into these practices. If any of this resonates - or if you’re going through something - would be happy to have you in.",

On a very hot day, they spotted a lake and stopped by, besieged by thirst. Buddha asked his younger disciple, famous for his impatient nature:\n\n– I’m thirsty. Can you bring me some water from that lake?\n\nThe disciple went to the lake but when he arrived, he saw that just at that moment, a bullock cart was going through it. As a result, the water became very muddy. The disciple thought: “I can’t give my teacher this muddy water to drink.”\n\nSo he came back and told Buddha:\n\n– The water in the lake is very muddy. I don’t think we can drink it.\n\nAfter half an hour, Buddha asked the same disciple to return to the lake and bring him some water to drink. The disciple returned to the lake.\n\nHowever, to his dismay, he discovered that the water was still dirty. He returned and told Buddha, this time with a conclusive tone:\n\n– The water of that lake can’t be drunk, we’d better walk to the village so the villagers can give us some water.\n\nBuddha did not answer him, but he did not move either. After a while, he asked the disciple himself to return to the lake and bring him water.\n\nThe disciple went to the lake because he did not want to challenge his master, but he was furious that he sent him back and forth to the lake, when he already knew that the muddy water could not be drunk.\n\nHowever, when he arrived this time, the water was crystal clear. So he picked up some of it and took it to Buddha.\n\nBuddha looked at the water, and then said to his disciple:\n\n– What did you do to clean the water?\n\nThe disciple did not understand the question, it was evident that he didn’t do anything. \n\nThen Buddha explained to him:\n\n*–* **Wait and let her be. So the mud settles on its own, and you have clean water.** \n\n**Your mind is like that too! When it is disturbed, you just have to let it be.** \n\n**Give it some time. Do not be impatient.** \n\n**I*****t will find the balance by itself. You do not have to make any effort to calm it down.*** \n\n**Everything will happen if you do not cling.**\n\n>!^(Image done with ChatGPT)!<",

    "text": "Would You Rather Be Happy Or Right? Every morning when we wake up, we’re presented with two forces: doubt and faith.\n\nDoubt is dark and heavy. It’s that nagging voice that tells us ‘*what if…’*, that list of ‘*yeah… but’s* and ‘*you don’t understand*’.\n\nIt’s endless, and it’s exhausting. It doesn’t take us anywhere. In fact, it probably just makes us sick.\n\nI mean, who hasn’t felt that weight of frustration, resentment, and confusion? That’s doubt for you. It’s persistent, but it goes nowhere.\n\nOn the other side, we have faith. Faith in what, you ask?\n\nFaith that we weren’t put on this earth to live in conflict with the people around us.\n\nFaith that there’s another way to live, a way that doesn’t constantly involve fighting and resisting.\n\nFaith that there’s something more than the stress and drama that often fills our lives.\n\nWe need to bend ourselves to service, not the other way around. The world isn’t designed to cater to our every need.\n\nWe weren’t put here to demand that everyone else tailor their lives around us.\n\nIf we think that way, we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment.\n\nAnd here’s the thing, we all have a choice. We can choose to focus on what we’re owed, what we deserve, and how unfair life is. We can stand there rubbing our hands, complaining that we haven’t gotten what’s rightfully ours, that life hasn’t given us the arc we think we deserve.\n\nOr we can shift our perspective. We can choose to be grateful for what we have, to accept life on its own terms.\n\nThe more we cling to our delusions, our obsessions, our ideas of entitlement, the more we create a situation that’s not going to improve until we change our attitude.\n\nWe have a choice, and here it is: *we can either be right, or we can be happy*.\n\nIf we decide to argue, to fight, to stand our ground in a way that brings conflict into our lives, then we’ve already made our choice.\n\nBut if we want to live in peace, we need to let go of *needing to be right* all the time.\n\nWe either surf the waves of life, or we fight against them.\n\nIf we choose to fight, we can’t be upset when the world fights back.\n\nIt’s just how it works.\n\nSo, today, I challenge you to choose differently. Choose humility. Choose faith. Choose gratitude.\n\nLife is going to unfold with or without us, but how we choose to respond is what makes all the difference.\n\n\\--------------------------------  \n*An excerpt from my* [*newsletter*](https://thezenjournal.substack.com/p/do-you-want-to-be-happy-or-right)",

    "text": "If the \"self\" Is an Illusion, Why Does It Control our Lives? Lately, I've been wrestling with something that seems contradictory on the surface but it keeps showing up in different areas of my life, and I'm genuinely curious what others here think about it. It’s something I've seen many of us argue about in the thread and it’s a valid talking point. \n\nWe talk a lot about **mindfulness**, presence, nonduality etc. The idea that our \"self\" is just an illusion, a collection of thoughts, memories, and feelings we mistakenly identify with. And that real freedom comes from letting go of that identification. This resonates deeply with me, especially in those moments of pure presence. There's such peace in simply *being*, without the burden of my personal story.\n\nBut then there's this other reality people bring up and that I would have to even identify with more through my own experiences and everything I've studied: **Beliefs actually shape our life and there can be no absence of beliefs.** It’s literally impossible to not have thoughts. Not in some cheesy \"manifest a Ferrari\" way. But in how your internal blueprint, those deep assumptions about who you are and what's possible, **actually change your behavior, perception, and even the opportunities you notice or don’t notice.** \n\nThis is exactly how **self-fulfilling prophecies** work. When I used to believe I couldn’t do something, I avoided situations where I could prove to myself that I might be able to. Our *beliefs* create emotional states, and we all know what happens when our emotions get in the way. **It's a loop.** One that operates beneath the surface but shapes everything in our lives. \n\n**So here's the paradox I can't stop thinking about: If the \"self\" is just an illusion... why does changing our self-concept seem to transform our** ***entire life*****? If identity is merely a mental construct, why does rewriting that construct by changing the story we tell about ourselves create such** ***real-world*** **shifts? Where does this fit within mindfulness? Is it possible to both see the self as illusory while still intentionally shaping that illusion? Can we embrace both truths? One that says identity is empty** ***and*** **that it's a powerful tool as well?** \n\nI’m thinking about exploring this in the future in my work but i do believe in self-fulfilling prophecies, which talks about how our identity gets in the way of what we want to achieve. I think it happens to all of us, which would mean the “self” is real and is something. \n\nI explored this in a piece I made and feel free to explore if you’d like. \n\n[Why You Keep Attracting the Same Life](https://youtu.be/-hjRZEj4_V4)\n\nBut more importantly, I wanted to bring this question *here*, because this community has some incredibly thoughtful minds. \n\nSo what do you think? Is personal transformation just a more sophisticated illusion? Can self-improvement coexist with nonduality, or are we just deepening the illusion of control?\n\nWould love to hear your perspectives, and how you view this debate?",

    "text": "How to deal with morning stress. I am currently unemployed after a PhD and get major guilt and FOMO about not utilising my day, any thoughts? Hi all.\n\nSo most mornings I wake up earlier than I would like and immediatley start thinking about what I would like to do today. I then think about the backlog of chores, job hunting etc and start to stress that my generally terrible prioritisation skills (I have ADHD) will end with me not optimising my day. \n\nI try to tell myself to trust myself and that my day doesn't need to be optimal and try to start my day calmly with a bit of TV and breakfast. I normally then look at my planner and get anxious again. I then just start doing any high priority task but I find that I cannot concentrate on it and am just constantly stressing about whether or not it's the right thing to be doing right now and if I'm doing it too slowly so that I'm clogging up other tasks. Again I try to be mindful and calm myself and just settle into the task, but these thoughts are so persistent.\n\nThe worst thing is that most of these tasks are very low stakes hobby tasks. I'm currently unemployed after finishing my PhD and I think partly there is a residual mind pattern from my PhD where I genuinely did have to stress about what I did and as its all self-disciplined I would always feel guilty for taking any time off. I also think it's partly FOMO as I'm aware that this time I have between jobs is a rare opportunity to do extra things I've always wanted to do. And throughout my PhD I always said \"when you're done\" to any desire I had. So now I want to do all sorts of things, painting, Woodwork, Spanish, coding, new games and more and I just get very overwhelmed.\n\nI've tried learning about non-striving and mindfulness but I struggle to link it with my day as I often find myself just lying in bed when I allow myself to not strive.\n\nAny thoughts would be much appreciated, thanks!",

    "text": "Who Asked For Your Advice? It’s funny how easy it is to go from believing something works for us to thinking it should work for everyone else too.\n\nI mean, we’ve all been there.\n\nWe feel strongly about something, and suddenly we think we have all the answers for others.\n\nOh, the irony.\n\nI am advising against giving advice... while, of course, offering more advice.\n\nBut I guess someone has to say it. There are definitely more effective ways to help others work through their problems.\n\nOf course, not all advice is the same, and it depends on the situation.\n\nIf a friend asks for your input, there's no harm in offering advice.\n\nAnd even when someone comes to you with a problem, sometimes it’s appropriate to offer guidance, so long as it’s done thoughtfully and with care.\n\nWith that being said, it's a good reminder that there is a delicate balance between sharing wisdom and respecting others’ freedom to choose their own path.\n\nThe thing is, it’s important to be clear about what *we* believe without judging others for their own beliefs.\n\nOur personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings are just that. Ours.\n\nWe’re not here to tell others what they should think or feel, we’re here to share what we’ve learned.\n\n**Games People Play**\n\nThis brings me to a concept introduced by psychiatrist Eric Berne with his book *Games People Play*.\n\nHe talks about the psychological games we play with each other, often without realizing it.\n\nThese ‘games’ aren’t always obvious, but they can shape how we communicate and interact with others, sometimes in not-so-helpful ways.\n\nFor example, one of the most common games is ‘*If It Weren’t For You*’, where an individual avoids taking responsibility by blaming someone else for their circumstances.\n\nAnother familiar game we all play is the ‘*I’m Only Trying to Help You’* game, where we offer advice without being asked, because the real goal is to control or judge.\n\nPeople might even ask for advice just to set up a *‘Why Don't You...? Yes, But...’* game, where every suggestion you give is met with a “yeah, but…”.\n\nThe danger of these games is that they create patterns of communication in our relationships, especially with loved ones, that aren't rooted in honesty.\n\nInstead of being straightforward with one another, we can fall into a cycle of manipulation and unspoken expectations.\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to value relationships where we can be real with each other.\n\nWhere we can disagree respectfully, share our opinions without hidden agendas, and truly listen to what others have to say.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nThe advice about advice ties back to our desire to help, especially when it comes to our kids, friends, and loved ones.\n\nWe might have the best motives, but sometimes, as they say, *the road to hell is paved with good intentions.*\n\nGiving advice can be tricky.\n\nIt’s one thing to share what *we* have done, but it’s a whole other thing to tell someone else what *they* should do. Especially when we don’t fully understand the consequences or risks involved.\n\nLet’s remember, there’s a difference between offering our experiences and telling others what to do.\n\nWe all need to be more careful with our words, and if someone hasn’t asked for advice, maybe it’s best to just listen.\n\nSometimes, that’s all someone really needs.\n\nSo let’s be mindful about how we communicate and what we offer to others, especially when we care about them.\n\nSometimes the best thing we can do is just be there, listen, and trust that others will find their own way.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*An excerpt from my* [*newsletter*](https://thezenjournal.substack.com/p/who-asked-for-your-advice)\n\n*p.s.

    "text": "Basic mindfulness questions I can't find the answers for Hi, I am 38 and having a lot of difficulty with intrusive thoughts about negative experiences or anxieties. I know these questions have probably been asked before, but I did search and couldn't find the exact situation. Sorry if this is novice.\n\n1. I don't think I understand the \"judgment\" part I am commonly asked to not do. I don't judge pain.. it just is. If I am hurting emotionally I am not making any judgments other than \"this hurts right now\". I don't think I'm stupid or evil or whatever, I just think I'm somewhat mentally ill which seems pretty objective to me. Does that mean I'm already being mindful or being completely blind? What does judging your emotions actually look like? \n\n2. I am aware that the goal, somewhat, is to be in the \"present\" and not \"in your head\". And to that I say it does help a little, but only as much as any other distraction. Focusing on what is going on around me or how my body feels doesn't make me feel any different than if I tried to read a book or watch something - I still can't pay attention because the intrusive thoughts are kind of like someone screaming in your face. You can pay attention to your body all you want but you're still going to hear the screaming, right? Am I missing something? My mind is capable of holding two thoughts at the same time. Again I do see how it can be helpful but most of my therapists have insisted that this is **the** solution for my anxiety and triggering PTSD and I just end up back at these two questions and they end up thinking I'm just not trying hard enough. \n\n3. You probably have heard of The Game, where if you think about the game you lose etc. I kind of feel like this whenever I try to be mindful. Just thinking about the fact that there is an experience or feeling or thought that is making me uncomfortable makes it stick in my mind even harder. The more mindful I try to be the louder the screaming becomes. I realize this is some subconscious thing probably but I can never get it to stop no matter how much I try. \n\nI realize it has to be practiced but even at a proficient level is the point basically still the same as self-distraction? Or does something else happen?",

    "text": "I build a FREE box breathing helper Hey there, I have nothing to sell, so I hope this doesn't fall under self promotion, I just build something that helped my mindfulness and I though why not make it available for everyone. \n\nI struggle a lot with stress, panic attacks, and similar problems. Box breathing helps me a lot, but I always had problems focusing or counting.   \n  \nSo I built a simple webapp where you can follow a nice animation, listen to instructions or just have some calm music in the background. \n\n[https://www.boxbreathing.online/](https://www.boxbreathing.online/)\n\nIf you have any experience with box breathing or have suggestions for my app, just let me know. It's free and no strings attached. \n\nHere are some facts about box breathing for the people who don't know it yet:\n\nBox breathing—also known as four-square breathing—is a simple but effective breathwork technique used to manage stress, increase focus, and regulate emotions. It's called \"box\" breathing because it involves four equal parts, just like the four sides of a box:\n\n* Inhale for 4 seconds\n* Hold your breath for 4 seconds\n* Exhale for 4 seconds\n* Hold your breath (empty lungs) for 4 seconds\n\nRepeat this cycle for several minutes.\n\nThis breathing method is so effective that it's been used by Navy SEALs, athletes, yoga practitioners, and even therapists as part of trauma-informed care.\n\n# 🧠 What Happens in the Body During Box Breathing?\n\nBox breathing might seem simple, but it has profound effects on your nervous system, cardiovascular system, and even your mindset.\n\n1. **Activates the Parasympathetic Nervous System:** When we're stressed, our body switches into \"fight or flight\" mode (sympathetic nervous system). Box breathing gently activates the parasympathetic nervous system, often called the \"rest and digest\" mode. This slows your heart rate, reduces cortisol (the stress hormone), and helps you feel safe and grounded again.\n2. **Balances Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide:** Many of us breathe too quickly, causing imbalances in our blood gases. By slowing your breath and adding short holds, box breathing restores oxygen CO₂ balance, helping your cells function optimally and your mind feel clearer.\n3. **Reduces Anxiety and Panic:** Breath is deeply tied to emotion. Slowing the breath sends a powerful message to your brain: \"We are safe.\" For those who experience panic attacks, anxiety, or PTSD, this technique can offer a moment of peace and control when everything else feels too much.\n4. **Improves Focus and Mental Clarity:** Slowing your breath helps you enter a flow state. It's especially useful before big presentations, during creative work, or when you're trying to make decisions under pressure.\n\n# ✨ Why Box Breathing Works (The Science)\n\nStudies in psychology, neuroscience, and mindfulness all confirm the power of intentional breathing. Here's what science says:\n\n* A 2017 study found that slow, controlled breathing improves emotional regulation and decreases anxiety symptoms.\n* Controlled breathing can enhance heart rate variability (HRV)—a key biomarker of resilience and emotional balance.\n* In trauma-sensitive therapy, breathwork is used to reconnect to the body, ground the nervous system, and increase a sense of safety.",

I was waiting to cross the street knowing that it was not time to do so yet because the hand wait symbol was on. I was waiting but as the wait got longer I began to drift into thought and basically was half paying attention to my surroundings. Eventually, it's like I became blind and as soon as I heard the crosswalk sound for the OTHER street, I started walking into traffic. The person waiting to drive by MY crosswalk began to honk and it wasn't until the second honk that I realized I was doing the wrong thing.\n\nThe driver must've thought I was insane. But as usual, I apologized but had no emotional reaction at first and just began to make my way as quickly as possible across the street while sinking in my pool of embarrassment. I feel like the biggest idiot to ever exist. I just don't know how to get past this absent mindedness.. I just feel insanely lucky that nothing happened aside from that.\n\nIt's not like anything bad was happening that was distracting me or taking my focus away. I just.. went on autopilot and it's like I lost consciousness. I don't know how to recover from this or why it's happening. Any tips and thoughts are welcome.",

    "text": "I caught my subconscious in the act. It felt like stumbling into a room I didn’t even know existed in my own mind, only to find someone else already living there. A few days ago, I woke up from a dream that left me totally drained. I was sweating, anxious, unsettled.\n\nAnd before I could even take a breath, something inside of me tried to reach for an old coping mechanism. The atmosphere was familiar, the beginning of an inner debate of “To do” or “Not to do”. When it passed, I often felt as if something had momentarily taken over me.\n\nBut this time, I didn’t react. I didn’t engage. I simply sat with it.\n\nIt felt like a scared little kid inside me, scrambling for the remote, trying to flip the channel from a horror movie to something lighthearted just to outrun the feeling. It was a reflex. Fast. Automatic.\n\nAnd that’s when it hit me. It wasn’t me doing that. It was just a pattern. And because it was familiar, I mistook it for identity. But this time, I saw the separation clearly.\n\nI didn’t try to fight or cotrol it. I just saw what was happening and shifted my focus. Got up. Washed my face. Started the day.\n\nAnd the urge? It was already gone by the time I started thinking about breakfast. Same for the uneasiness from the dream. Not because I fixed anything or resisted hard. But because I didn’t feed it. It lost the only thing that kept it alive. My attention. \n\nThat was the first time I realized how much I’d been feeding my inner noise without knowing it. Even trying to ignore it or pretend it wasn’t there was still attention. I’d been doing that all my life.\n\nIt’s like when you’re so angry at someone that you stop talking to them or avoid eye contact. It looks like you’ve withdrawn your attention. But inside, you’re even more aware of their presence. You replay them. Obsess over them. Your focus is still locked on them. And that silent pressure builds, until all you want is to escape, just to breathe. \n\nFor me, it’s shame, loneliness, cravings, regret, frustration, anxiety, and more. Because I was afraid to let them be, I couldn’t let them go. I carried them unwillingly, tucking them into the corners of my mind, where they pressed against me right before sleep when there was nothing left to distract me. \n\nReal detachment didn’t come from rejecting the feeling or trying to control it. It came from letting things be the way they wanted to be, seeing the pattern, recognizing it wasn’t me and choosing to shift my focus. Fully, freely.\n\nI’ve finally made peace with whatever shows up in the corners of my mind. I’d rather meet it with awareness and let it go than keep running from it, and I continue practicing mindfulness meditation.",

The main way I recognised this was through the idea of prayer and imaging that god is the power of attraction itself. Through my research I have came across the trinity in recent years and have composed the following. I would appreciate feedback on this and to see what strangers may think or feel about this. \n\nThe power of 3 has been prevalent through many walks of life, a common phrase used is 3rd times a charm. We begin all our prayers by acknowledging the holy trinity, in the name of the father, the son and the Holy Spirit. Is it possible that the trinity may mean something to our own individual lives? \n\nI think that by looking at the holy trinity it may be looked at simply as this, the body, the soul and the split when examined at a personal level and that this may be the principal to living a balanced life. \n\nTHE BODY - this is our outward self, our physical bodies. We can change and alter this by a means of physical exercise etc.\n\nTHE SOUL - this is our inward self, our thought and our livelihood. It may be fulfilled by things such as music, the way we fell towards short term things like food and nature. \n\nTHE SPIRIT - this is our deep inner feelings, our compounded feelings which are formed over a prolonged period of time. May be altered by the certain types of relationships we have between partners and family members. \n\nThis is just the surface on which I have researched but would appreciate and outsiders opinion on this matter.\n\nThanks",

Hey fellow humans, \n\nA few months ago, I took a personality test (the Big Five), and while the results were interesting, the long text report was honestly overwhelming. It felt difficult to truly connect and reflect on what I was reading. So, I experimented by turning the test results into an audio podcast just for myself—something I could listen to calmly and mindfully.\n\nThis little experiment unexpectedly became a deeply engaging experience. Listening allowed me to slow down and stay present with the insights, helping me genuinely understand myself better. It also sparked thoughtful conversations with my partner and friends about our relationships and personalities, deepening our interactions.\n\nI thought some of you might resonate with this way of exploring self-awareness and reflection.\n\nPS: If you'd like to try it yourself, I set up a free code (\"**MINDFULNESS**\") for the first 3 people interested.

Me ha cambiado la vida literalmente, no sabía cómo implementarlo, bueno ni cómo hacerlo. Estaba pasando por una mala época, en donde no tenía ganas de nada, no me enfrentaba a nada tenía pereza de todo, pero un día metido TikTok me apareció un vídeo, de un chico moreno en el cual hablaba de desarrollo personal, sinceramente en ese momento pensé, “otro con el agua fría”, pero estaba totalmente equivocado, en ese TikTok me habló de algo llamado alter ego, que según el chico era una personalidad alternativa.\n\n\n\n Lo que más me hizo pensar fue que no tenías que cambiar toda tu personalidad de repente, si no, que la utilizarías en momento puntuales en situaciones donde realmente fuera necesario. Me llamó tanto la atención que le escribí y le pedí ayuda para crear el mío. Me sorprendió, pensaba que iba a cobrarme unos 16/20 euros que sinceramente no estaba dispuesto a pagar, pero no, me ayudó gratis. Sus palabras fueron, “si yo pude cambiar con esto cualquier persona puede y quiero ayudarte gratis. \n\n\n\nHa cambio tu tienes que ayudar a otra persona de manera altruista” me ayudó me pasó una guía a la cual el quería venderla por 12 euros, sin embargo, me la dio gratis ¡GRATIS!. Me dijo que por favor no la vendiera. Sinceramente hablamos durante un mes, me ayudó a crear mi alter ego y después hablamos como amistad, una persona con muchas ambiciones, con ganas de ayudar a la gente. Me pareció una persona admirable. Me contó que le daba pena que se manchara lo del desarrollo personal, por culpa de personas que querían lucrarse de otras. Me dijo que el desarrollo personal era ocuparse de uno mismo, de buscar la mejor versión de tí y que dependiendo de las skills que una quiera obtener se va poder ganar dinero o no, que el desarrollo personal no te promete dinero, pero si te promete bienestar y sabiduría. Disfrutar y alcanzar tu mejor persona. Sinceramente me conmovió, me pareció una persona honesta. Quería comentarlo por si alguien quiere saber más de alter ego o si quiere ayudar a ese tipo de personas de crecer estaré encantado de darle sus TikTok. Ahora voy dar mi opinión, sinceramente, el alter ego me ha obligado a hacer muchas cosas, he ligado, he hecho exposiciones delante de toda la universidad, algo que en la vida hubiera hecho, me he sacado el proyecto final y gracias a ello me convertido en alguien que hace 1 un año jamás hubiera imaginado, se ha convertido me mi nueva personalidad, sin saberlo, tengo que agradecerlo, ya se porque muchas celebridades lo utilizan, me ha ayudado muchísimos, tengo muchas anécdotas gracias a ello, puedo hablar con cualquier persona, hacer amigos, hablar en público. \n\n\n\nTantas cosas que me sorprender que esto exista. Quiero contar esta historia por si puedo ayudar a alguien y devolver el favor que hizo ese chico por mi. \n\nUn abrazo \n\nTu mejor amigo aquí ♾️🤞🏾",

    "text": "Dopamine is an Ego problem This is what I have realised:\n\nEgo causes us to do things. It motivates us to achieve more so that we can feel safer. These can be things from dressing nice to going to the gym or trying to learn a new language or learn a new skill. \n\nIf your sense of ego is damaged due to trauma, you will feel a higher motivation to achieve things. So if you feel like you are constantly chasing dopamine left and right, hang on with me - this is a good thing and you can use it to your advantage.\n\nNow, this is how dopamine works. For every action that you have ever done in your life, depending on which setting you were in, you had a dopamine reward for it. This is why even though heroin is the most addictive substance on earth, we do not get addicted to it unless we have tried it at least once.\n\nSo our brain has a table of actions, ranked based on dopamine reward, and when we have negative emotions (ego is suffering) the brain will send us a signal to \"do something\" so that we can feel safe again. Now, this \"something\" is picked from the dopamine table based on a factor of criteria e.g. When did I last masturbate? or I haven't eaten a burger in a while. or Going to the gym right now would be nice. There is no distinction here between \"good\" or \"bad\" actions. It is simply a equation of \"reward\" × \"setting / time of day\" × \"novelty (when did I last do this thing? or first time doing it)\".\nThen the dopamine table gets updated so the brain has a reference for the next time. \n\nNow, what would happen if you just decided to stop masturbating? There are three options: \na) You will have urges to masturbate again / watch porn or go porn phishing\nb) You will have urges to do something else from that dopamine table to fill that gap\nc) You do nothing \n\nIf you choose a) or b), you are digging a hole in the future, a \"dopamine hole\". That means, whenever the ego is threatened and you feel negative emotions again, the action you just did is reinforced and you are back at square one: chasing dopamine again. \n\nThis isn't always bad necessarily if you have healthy coping mechanisms. But ideally, you should want to choose option c)\n\nPersonally, after days and nights of chasing dopamine, after indulging in the most pleasurable experiences imagineable that left me with that void again, I just kind realised \"What if I did nothing?\" What if I just sat there and did nothing for as long as I could?\n\nAnd one day, one day that started as a usual dopamine chasing day, where I digested some substances, was listening to music, browsing social media, reading and watching stuff, I just kinda froze. I was like \"What am I running from? When will this stop? What if I just looked within myself?\". And in that psychedelic and cannabis infused moment, I started meditating. I was meditating like I was a little child noticing things on their body for the first time. The novelty of the experience of noticing new little details about how the body worked was fascinating. Things like, how small muscle groups move the eye inch by inch when I try to focus at a specific point, how my body feels when I hold my breath for too long, how my empty lungs felt when I was starting to breath deeply and fill them in. \n\nAnd for some reason, at that point something magical happen. A moment that not many people get to experience. I had a boom effect. It was as if all the dopamine that I refused to let out by doing all the other meaningless things was released on the spot, filling me with a rush of euphoria. I said to myself \"This must be how Buddha felt. I am enlightened now. I am God.\" (Probably a bit of a schizophrenia moment but I don't care)\n\nAnd then I wanted to stay in that moment of mindfulness, I wanted to feel more of this euphoria of doing nothing but just noticing. And I did just that for an hour or so and then I went downstairs, drank a protein shake and I was completely mindblown by what just happened. \n\nI have this theory but its completely empirical/non-science based: When we have dopamine urges, we think that we get satisfied for doing stuff, but the truth is, the moment we are motivated to do something, dopamine has already acted and it's over. The only thing left is us searching for an action to do. Because if we just sat there doing nothing and dopamine just stopped working, it would kill us on the spot since we need dopamine for moving our limbs and stuff. So what I think happened there was, due to homeostasis, the body was expecting dopamine to pass through somewhere at some point, and because I was holding it hostage for so long, it kinda just broke/surrendered. It congratulated me by giving me euphoria for doing nothing. Because that dopamine would have had to flow anyways and then get oxidized or whatever. But because I chose to be mindful, and in combination with all the previous times of chasing dopamine and feeling empty, my mind kinda said \"Maybe you are right. Maybe chasing dopamine is not the way and this realisation was very important so I will reward you for it. Maybe you saved us from going to a very dark path\".\n\nAfter this experience, I had a huge discharge of emotions and now I feel like my cPTSD got better. I went to work today and I was feeling the usual negative emotions and overthinking, but at least my ego was happy to share them with me.\n\nTldr: If you stop trying to fill the dopamine hole, it will fill back by itself",

    "text": "The Jar Of Luck 🤞🏻 //a random thought that's been in my head for a while//  \n\n\n(credits to my dog; i was thinking all of this while i took him on a poop walk)  \n\n\nSometimes, I feel like every person is born with a jar full of luck, completely filled at the start. As we go through life, we use up that luck in different moments—some big, some small, some intentional, and some without even realizing it.  \n\n\nBut the problem is, we don’t always get to choose where that luck gets spent. There are times when we waste it on the wrong things, the wrong people, or the wrong situations. And then, when we actually need it the most—when everything is falling apart—that jar is already empty.  \n\n\nLately, I feel like I’ve been pouring my luck into the wrong place. Maybe it's been working in my favor when it comes to relationships, helping me talk to someone, get closer, maybe even be with them. But at the same time, everything else feels stuck. My career isn't moving forward, my days don’t feel good, and I’m left feeling drained and frustrated.  \n\n\nAnd then, the thought creeps in—what if I had just said no? What if I had held on to that luck a little longer, redirected it toward something that could actually change my future? What if the universe had focused on helping me grow instead of handing me something that, in the end, just makes me feel worse?  \n\n\nMaybe luck isn’t something we spend—it’s something we trade. And sometimes, we make the wrong deal.  \n\n\ni hope things change and turn in my favour without me making any major sacrifices that actually make me happy in life at the moment.  \n\n\ncredits : ravyop",

    "text": "Here’s the thing: you’re dying too. – An update [Back in winter, I shared that I’ve been living with an ALS diagnosis (also known as MND or Lou Gehrig’s Disease) for nearly five years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1iefkpj/heres_the_thing_youre_dying_too/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed with this rare, untreatable, and terminal illness, which progressively paralyzes the body while leaving the mind and senses fully intact, I was told I had only 24 to 36 months to live.\n\nYet here I am.\n\nI’m weaker than when I last posted. I'm now almost completely immobile below the neck, but I'm still here.\n\nAs time passed and the disease claimed my feet, legs, arms, hands, and now even my breath, I suffered. I could feel it, like being bitten by a snake—its venom spreading slowly, killing me gradually but inevitably.\n\nAnd yet, amid the suffering, I began to recognize an unexpected gift: a strange, enforced contemplation that emerged as I lingered year after year on the threshold between life and death.\n\nAs the 13th-century poet Rumi wrote, “The wound is where the light enters you.”\n\nHere in this twilight space—a place we must all eventually go, though few truly understand—I’ve been given a rare opportunity for one final, grand adventure: to map this unfamiliar territory and report back.\n\nThat’s when I began to write.\n\nAt first, journaling was simply a way to learn how to type with my eyes and organize my thoughts.\n\nOver time, I realized it could be something more: a way to leave behind messages for my children, notes they might turn to during times of hardship or when they face the inevitability of their own mortality, when I can no longer be by their side.\n\nSo I kept writing.\n\nEventually, it dawned on me that I was responsible for sharing these reflections more broadly. Not knowing how much time I had left before something like pneumonia could silence even my eyes, I took the fastest route I could: I started a blog and shared it with this group in February.\n\nLast week, I completed my 50th post, written entirely with my still-functioning eyes. And I’m continuing to write—until I finish sharing the best of my journal from the past year, or until my time runs out.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not selling anything and don’t want anything from you. I want this writing to be a presence—a friend you can visit now and then, to share a conversation about this life we all inhabit. If I succeed, then even after this skin and brain no longer confine me, I’ll still be able to support my family and friends and perhaps even make new ones.\n\nTo let them know that what waits beyond is not annihilation, but an intimacy with *what is*—something so radiant that our limited human minds can only glimpse it, because it is too bright to behold.\n\n[https://twilightjournal.com/](https://twilightjournal.com/)\n\nBest,\n\nBill",

I feel so practically aware of everything I need to; my life is full and fortunate. I am surrounded by love, opportunity, and the inherent beauty of the world. \n\nI was always anxious, and largely unsafe growing up. But I have done a lot of work since I was a kid, and healed to a tremendous degree! I am aware of the fact that I can now wonderfully live my life without worry about triggers and with decent effectiveness. I have a job, I'm financially independent. I have recently succeeded at implementing more exercise into my life, getting better sleep, eating healthier, etc. \n\nI have worked hard to build better relationships and have a steady boyfriend, good friends, and best-as-can-be familial relationships. \n\nAll stated, I can't seem to shift my focus to the present moment. I have read several books on mindfulness and do a guided yoga session and separately meditate minimum 10 minutes every day. I am currently obsessed with a desire to be present, so much so that it pulls me from what I'm doing (even sometimes bringing me to tears or anxiety attacks). I am not present; I am upset and comparing and devastated by the fact that I cannot seem to make myself be present. I recently read the power of now and it feels like cement on my chest-- Every word of it makes sense to me, every sentiment rings true, and I cannot figure out how to practically change my default pull to obsession with old pains or fears of future failure.\n\nThe irony of it all is rather clear to me. \n\nI'm feeling frustrated right now. I don't know how to make what I believe intellectually translate to an actual change, and I am really upset with how much I am still not enjoying what are clearly blessings in front of me. My efforts towards mindfulness have simply become a tool for punishing myself, and removing me from the present moment. \n\n  \nHas anyone else struggled with this? What can I do differently?  \nI feel like all of the practical and intellectual steps are already happening, but clearly something I'm doing is not working.",

    "text": "My Mindfulness Journey I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if your brain feels like it’s constantly sprinting and your body’s exhausted just from existing, you’re not alone.\n\nA few months ago, I hit a point where I couldn’t keep pretending I was fine. I wasn’t sleeping. I was constantly overthinking. I’d zone out during conversations because my mind was racing in five directions. And the worst part? I had no idea how to stop.\n\nI used to think mindfulness meant sitting cross-legged in silence for hours, or lighting a candle and instantly feeling healed. (Spoiler: it’s not that.)\n\nFor me, it started with one honest thought: “I don’t want to live like this anymore.”\n\nI started looking into mindfulness like actual tools and practices that didn’t feel fake or performative. And I found a few ebooks that genuinely helped. Not in a “this fixed everything” way but more like “this gave me space to breathe.”\n\nMindful Existing — helped me realize that being present isn’t about being perfect. It’s just about being. No pressure to solve everything, just learning how to sit with what is.\n\nSelf-Care Success — this one hit me hard. I’d been treating rest like a reward, not a right. This book reframed how I look at taking care of myself.\n\nRooted — felt like a hug and a mirror. It helped me come back to myself when I felt completely scattered. \n\nThese books didn’t give me “the answers” as much as they gave me permission. Permission to stop performing. Permission to feel what I was feeling. Permission to take care of myself like I actually mattered. I still have anxious days. I still overthink. But I come back to myself faster now. I know how to pause. I know how to breathe. And honestly, that’s everything. So yeah if you’re in the thick of it, and you’re tired of pretending you’ve got it all together, maybe start with one page. One breath. One honest moment with yourself.\n\nThat’s where it started for me.\n\nI don’t want to get banned for self promotion or anything so I won’t post the link here but if you want to check them out, upvote or comment and I’ll send it over to you.\n\nMuch love to everyone here!",

Watching the trees sway in their own rhythm, birds glide without effort, clouds drift without a destination — none of it rushed, yet none of it stagnant.\n\nIt made me wonder why I’m always sprinting toward something — inbox zero, some ideal version of myself, the next thing to check off. But nature? It unfolds exactly when it’s meant to.\n\nI didn’t meditate. I didn’t breathe in a special way. I just observed. And that felt like enough.\n\n**Does this quote resonate with anyone else?**\n\nHave you had a moment where slowing down felt more productive than pushing forward?\n\nWould love to hear how others here apply mindfulness in motion — walking, noticing, or just being.",

    "text": "My Way Or The Highway \n\n>Resentment comes from not getting our way yesterday, anger comes from not getting our way today, and fear comes from worrying that we won’t get our way tomorrow.\n\n\n\nThe common denominator in all these three states of distress is our fixation on \"my way.\" When we place ourselves at the center of the universe, we create our own suffering.\n\nIt’s a tough pill to swallow, but it’s true. When we get too focused on our own way of doing things, we miss out on the bigger picture.\n\nAnd, the antidote to this *‘me..me…me…’* mindset?\n\nOnce again, like I’ve been stating over the last few posts, it’s *humility*. It’s the practice of putting others before ourselves.\n\nThe reality is, we’re not the center of the universe, and other people have problems too. Maybe it’s time we give them a hand rather than expecting everything to revolve around us.\n\nSelfish desires are part of human nature, and they’re nothing new.\n\nIn the *Bhagavad Gita*, Krishna tells Arjuna that there are two main reasons we get caught up: selfish desires and anger[1](https://thezenjournal.substack.com/p/my-way-is-the-right-way#footnote-1-160911973).\n\nThousands of years later, these same human tendencies continue to challenge us. When we focus too much on what we want or how things should go and get attached to it, it can make us resentful, fearful, and unhappy.\n\nWhat happens when we focus on the past*(resentment)* or the future*(fear*)? We get stuck.\n\nWe miss out on the present and keep making mistakes. And guess what? Those mistakes just lead to more resentment and fear about the consequences.\n\nIt’s a vicious cycle.\n\n\n\n**The Double Edged Sword of Humilty**\n\nThe tricky part about humility is that sometimes we rationalize our actions. We think, *“I’m only doing this to help you”* or *“I’m telling you this because I care.”*\n\nBut sometimes, that’s just our way of justifying our own desires. We might think we’re right, but it’s important to remember that we’re not the center of everything.\n\nHumility doesn’t come naturally to us. It’s not because we’re selfish or ill-willed; it’s just that we tend to think our way is the best way. And we often act as though everyone else should just get on board.\n\nThe truth is, though, when we live in the past (with resentment) or the future (with fear), we miss out on the only thing we have control over: *the present moment*.\n\n\n\n**The Present Moment**\n\nYou’ve heard the saying, *“Today is a gift, that’s why they call it the present.”* It’s a bit corny, but it’s true. If we’re not living in the present, we’re not really living at all.\n\nHow we do anything is how we do everything.\n\nIf we don’t take the time to live fully today, it’ll spill over into the future in ways we might not even realize.\n\nSo, let’s make the most of today, no matter what. Even if life feels tough, there’s always something good to look for. If we focus on the good, we’ll find it. If we focus on the bad, well, we’ll find that too.\n\nLife’s all about perspective.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*An excerpt from my* [*newsletter*](https://thezenjournal.substack.com/p/my-way-is-the-right-way)",

That i was the one thinking those thoughts. Cause if it looks like you, and talks like you, it must be you, right?\n\nBut i realized it wasn't. Like, at all.

Laughing loudly, grinning a little too wide?That was me.\n\nAnd i realized that, that concept of the person i idolized, that i wanted to be, but would be impossible cause it was SO DIFFERENT from me.

As soon as I was told the news, saw the body as we await the coroner, I was adjusting.   All of the family was in immediate shock and acted accordingly.   We all handle traumatic events differently, so when I was able, I went to my meditation area near the water on the rocks outdoors.   I began meditating, but instead of freeing the mind, I connected to the spiritual.   I focused  on my Sister (i.e., cousin) and connected spiritually.   It was a connection that allowed me to speak and see her in the spiritual space now.  We spoke and I listened to her talk to me.  She spoke of joyfulness and admired my environment and current  way of life.  We connected. The point is \"medition\" of this tragic event (the passing of my family member) allowed me to cope.  I believe my daily practice of deep meditation and mindfulness along with other inner self activities (grounding, yoga, exercise, etc) daily helps me cope with life.  \n\nI just wanted to share this moment as I deal with life, understanding you must experience the emotional ups and downs and cope, to live a peaceful life and enjoy the present and appreciate the changes as they must occur!",

I could talk to anyone about anything and I really really enjoyed it. I was very fun to be around and I was always asking myself how people take life so seriously. Confidence was my middle name or whatever.\n\nWhen I was a teenager (25 M now)i was clinically depressed. I couldn't see it then but being depressed in some point on your life can teach you many things about yourself and make you more human. Even then, on my depression mode,when i was around people I was very fun to be around. I was making fun of myself and I didn't take anything seriously. I also turned into being a philosopher. My thoughts very deep and meaningful \n\nAnyway back to 3 years ago, I had the best years of my life.

Life without charisma sucks. My greatest weapon, my beautiful mind, has betrayed me.\n\nWorking out, eating healthy are my lifestyle. I practice doing literally nothing for some brain discharge and sometimes cold showers are my way to maybe increase a little bit my brain fucntion.\n\nAlso blowing some steam by taking about it is also a way for me to feel a little bit better.\n\nI you have any advice or any other forum that I can post things like that, I would be more than happy to listen\n\nThanks",

    "text": "Meditated for 5 minutes in my car and it helped more than I thought I was having one of those mornings where everything felt heavy spilled coffee, forgot my umbrella, and then sat in traffic on the way to work feeling like I could explode. My mind was racing at a million miles per hour. Then something weird happened: instead of cursing at the honking cars, I remembered a breathing technique I learned in a wellness class. I rolled my window up, sat up straight in the driver’s seat, and closed my eyes. For the next 5 minutes, I focused only on my breath: inhale for four seconds, hold for four, exhale for four.\n\nAt first it felt strange doing this in traffic, but slowly, I noticed my shoulders loosen. The tightness in my chest eased. By the time I finished the 5 minutes, even the car horn seemed a little quieter. I opened my eyes and realized I hadn't panicked at all  the freeway was still slow, but I felt surprisingly calm. It was like a tiny mental reset in the middle of chaos.\n\nNow I try to find small pockets of time during busy days to do something similar, even if it's just a few deep breaths at my desk or listening fully to one song during my commute. It reminds me that I don't need a calm situation to feel calm  sometimes I just have to create that peace myself.",

It sounds simple, but it's been surprisingly effective in grounding me and boosting my overall sense of peace. Anyone else practice something similar? What are your go-to tiny gratitude moments?",

Everyday I just get up, go to school, go to work, and then come home. I have a lot of friends, but I just feel empty inside whenever I’m around them. I would fake my laugh every time they say something funny and I would smile a lot around them, but I don’t feel genuinely happy. At the same time I don’t feel completely empty to the point where I have no emotions at all. Sometimes I would be in my room by myself and wonder what I’m doing wrong sometimes. I would feel that there’s no one out there who really cares about me and I would cry by myself. I have a boyfriend I love him very much. I am happy whenever I’m around him, but after that I just lose all that feeling when I’m by myself. I talk to him about my feelings a lot, but it just doesn’t seem like it’s helping me at all. It’s probably doing the opposite. It makes me feel like I’m burdening him with all my feelings which I why I feel like I can’t talk to him anymore.

Despite this, and despite signs saying not to talk during performances in the venue, I could hear two people behind me chatting at full volume during the performances. \n\nI had to battle annoyance and irritation, thinking these people to be selfish, entitled and ruining my experience. I tried to observe my annoyance, tried to enjoy the performance as much as I could and tried to realise that this is an impermanent state. The performance will conclude and we will all move on with life. The people may stop talking (they didn't). I may be able to move away (this did eventually happen). I even thought I should speak to them to keep it down, but others behind them were talking, they weren't the only ones. \n\nHow do I apply mindfulness to overcome this scenario? I feel like my acute annoyance really ruined the performance for about 5 mins, and I think being truly mindful may have limited the level of annoyance.",

Small backstory, my mom is a professor and she let one of her students (who is like 28) move in with us in an attempt to help her out. This was a horrible idea but I get that she was just trying to help strangers. Also important to not may be that I’m diagnosed autistic. \n\nBut anyway, this girl is evil, she would come into our house and make fun of me (20) to my face and send things about me like quotes or pictures to all of her friends so they could make fun of me too. I never retaliated or lashed out about this because I didn’t want to upset my mom. Then one day we got into an argument because she didn’t like that *when she asked me if she looked masculine* I said yes, because she asked and that’s my true feelings but I told her that was ok, it’s not a bad thing to look like any certain way, some people really want that and i wasn’t judging her. But ig she really hated it and wanted to argue about it so i told her all my true feelings about how i never meant to hurt her but she sure loves to hurt people and how she’s been doing it for months. And that yk not to brag but at least i never intentionally bullied her or sent things about her to others so they could bully her too, etc. like up until this point i had done nothing but slightly reflect her daily banter back to her because i have learned in life that mimicking people when talking to them makes them like you more, but other than that I hadn’t done anything. \n\nWell I guess she REALLY didn’t like what i had to say so she scheduled a work meeting with my mom to “tattle tale” on me and showed my mom screenshots of our texts. And I did get in a lot of trouble by my mom, and when i told her I felt like she didn’t love me and that i wanted to move out she got very upset because she would “obviously care more about her daughter than some stranger” but if that’s the case why did you read our personal argument.. why did you put up with her obviously unrelated and unprofessional meeting then, why am I being punished?.. idk.. and my dad had my back and still does but it doesn’t help..\n\nTLDR: I just feel so angry and resentful, I feel like I will never move on, like the only way I could move on is if she disappeared from this earth. I used to volunteer at my mom’s work and help her out, but because of a personal argument with someone SHE LET LIVE HERE, I can never go back, my relationship with my parents is ruined.. I just feel like all I’ve done is lose, but she hasn’t lost anything, if anything she’s gained, and she STILL lives here.. idk I don’t think I can ever recover but I really really want to… any advice on “moving on”?",

    "text": "Living with pain and finding stillness. Hey guys,,\n\nI just wanted to share something a little personal. Lately, I’ve been dealing withh chronic lower abdominal pain from a soft tissue injury. It's been pretty tough some days, and I will have surgery when I get the money to hopefully fix it.\n\nWhat I’ve been realizing through this journey is that meditation isn't about escaping what's happening. It’s not about blocking the pain or forcing myself to feel better. It's about allowing everything to be exactly as it is, without resistance. Some days the pain feels overwhelming, but even then, there’s this quiet space underneath it all that’s untouched. When I stop trying to fight the experience and just rest as the awareness behind it, something shifts. the pain might still be there, but the feeling of being trapped by it begins to dissolve. I’m learning that peace isn’t something I have to achieve after the surgery or after the pain goes away. It’s already here, even now, even in the middle of all this. Just by noticing that I am the one seeing the pain, not the one being hurt by it,, everything softens a little.\n\nSo if you're going through something tough too, know you're not alone. You don't have to be perfect or fix anything right away. Just rest a little deeper into the simple presence of being. Let it hold you exactly as you are..\n\nThere's another thing that I heard Sam Harris saying that really sticked with me. He said:\n\n\"If you could have only tomorrow what you are grateful for today, how many things would you be grateful for?\"\n\nThat opened my eyes to how many good things I have in my life, even though I am facing big battles.",

I recently have been doing through a huge disillusionment about the core of my life's aims recently. \n\nI have a comfortable lifestyle. My immediate needs are met. I have stability to live a normal life.\n\nI have every material thing I thought I wanted to be able to start working towards goals that use to be the loudest ideas and thoughts in my head. \n\nI thought having all of this would allow me to have the space to do what I want and go about it with passion, but I honestly don't have a fire lit inside my being. My passion is gone. \n\nThe more I meditate and create mindfulness for myself, I keep hitting this wall of feeling \"not good enough\" and \"unworthy.\" \n\nJust wondering if you've ever been at a place in life where you felt this feeling, and curious -- really -- about how specifically this realization came to you.. What were you doing or what had you just \"achieved\" when you had a similar experience in life. I know I cannot be the only one..",

Feel your body, feel the enviroment around you, hear the sounds around you. This is all effortless, instinctive, no need to think around it, although it is an ACTIVE process, meaning you willingly invest your attention into the now.\n\nSomething that can help is [Pranayama](https://youtu.be/ML4T2pRPd1c?si=9DDirhJpEdMwhIv1). The ego is constantly pulling us towards illusion and to counterrest the pull you need energy, which you get from transmuting\n\nAlso, mantra chanting (for the 7 chakras) can help. By vibrating the chakras with the [7 mantra vowels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq4_FcpaMOA&list=PLbZsCM6xnLIXSCushXKjaD1nayLLBHZdu) every day you regenerate them, this will make you more present",

Fight not your neighbour but rather all the things that cause you and your neighbour to fight. Would you have war? Wage it within yourself. Disarm yourself of every empty thought, fear and vain desire that make your world a suffocating cage, and you shall find it broader than the Universe; and you shall roam that Universe at will; and nothing shall be an hindrance to you. That is the only war worth waging. Engage yourself in such a war, and you shall no longer find the time for any other wars which would become to you abhorrent and diabolic tricks meant to distract your mind, and sap your strength, and cause you thus to lose the great war with yourself which is indeed an holy war. To win that war is to win undying glory. But victory in any other war is worse than any humiliating defeat. And that is the horror of all men’s wars, that the victor and the vanquished equally espouse defeat. Would you have peace? Look not for it in wordy peace documents; nor strive to grave it even in the rocks. For the pen that scribbles ‘Peace’ with ease can scribble ‘War’ with equal ease; and the chisel that engraves ‘Let us have peace’ can easily engrave ‘Let us have war.’ But once you have understood the timeless glory of being human & freed yourself from things that cause you & your neighbour to fight. You would be at real peace. Wage a war within yourself to end the war outside.",

    "text": "Help me understand what it means to love yourself (or have feelings towards yourself) I don't recall ever having feelings for myself; it is simply not something that makes sense to me. But I've heard people say that they hate themselves, or conversely, I've had a partner tell me \"you'll never be happy until you love yourself\" and that statement simply does not compute to me. I can have an emotion towards something or someone, but I am not multiple identities that can like one another. I have thoughts about myself, that makes sense. But feel something?\n\nI understand some people don't accept themselves (where they lie to themselves (by denying their own truth) to feel better), but still, the concept of having feelings towards your own self is completely alien to me. Can someone explain it? Do you have feelings towards yourself? Is it some metaphysical point of view? Below I've listed some examples of situations in my everyday life. Thanks 💛\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\n\n1) I have a thought that I am very bad at soccer. This thought is based on my personal experiences of seeing others play, and then observing my ability to perform at the sport. I would say that most people (probably 80%) are better than me at it. But this is what I think, and whereas I can be wrong about it, it doesn't make me feel anything. It's like saying the sky is blue. These things just are. Why would I feel something about it?\n\nNow, let's say I want to be really good at soccer; it's my dream. I spend hundreds of hours practicing and yet I still can't kick the ball straight. I can understand this generates emotions, like frustration, feeling down, defeated. Maybe even angry. But none of those emotions are towards myself. They are reflective of the situation. Exactly the same like it would be to wake up for your wedding day and see it pouring rain outside - I'm upset, maybe disappointed, but not at myself... I don't control the weather. It's the same for soccer. I tried, I still suck... it is what it is.\n\n2) I'm with friends at a bar and I'm having fun sliding the drinks down the bar table to my friends. We're all having a good laugh, but I take it too far and decide to slide the drink of a stranger down to them, but it falls off the table and breaks on their clothes. I've hurt them with the glass and I feel terrible about it. I tell myself \"oh no. I took it too far, lost control and acted like a child and now hurt someone. Next time maybe a bit more restraint\". I feel upset, but not at \"myself\", I'm upset that I hurt the person and lost control. I don't hate myself... I don't feel anything towards myself at all. But I am upset and feeling down.\n\n3) I have a friend which is super funny and can crack me up. I have another friend who is depressive and always negative. I much prefer hanging out with my funny friend, and I would say I like them better. But I myself am not funny, and often I am depressed. But I don't dislike myself. I don't see myself and feel bad about not being funny. Again, it doesn't make sense. Whether I put the effort to try to be funny or not (say I wanted to be a funny person), all these things just \"are\". I would need to be someone else to be able to not like (or like) myself, right? There's no duality within.\n\n4) I want to lose weight to look better and feel lighter. I tell myself I won't buy anymore junk food. Yet everyday I pass in front of a bakery and feel tempted and end up buying a chocolate croissant, completely going against my promise not to eat such foods. I am not happy about it. I genuinely wonder why it's so hard, and how I ended up becoming so weak-willed. But I do not feel anything towards myself about this. I don't disgust or dislike myself, nor do I beat myself up. This is who I am right now. There's just no dimension for such feelings to exist towards the \"I\". It doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n5) the only example I could think of that might come close to having feelings for myself is if I got really drunk and did something stupid. In that case \"I\" do not identify with \"drunk I\", and \"I\" could feel ashamed for what \"drunk I\" did. But even in that case it's really a stretch... maybe if I routinely got black out drunk and developed a sense for this separate entity (drunk me), then maybe I could come to know them and dislike them... but I'd be letting myself be \"split\" by allowing myself to get drunk over and over to create that separate self. Perhaps then maybe?",

    "text": "How mindfulness helped me stop feeling like I was constantly \"behind\" in life and a resource I built for others struggling like I was Hey everyone,  \nI just wanted to share a bit of my experience in case it resonates with anyone here. For years, I felt like I was stuck in this cycle of always rushing, comparing myself to others, and feeling like I was never doing enough even when things were objectively fine.\n\nI stumbled into mindfulness almost by accident during a tough period. I started small, 3 minutes of breathing, noticing thoughts, journaling what I noticed. Over time, it wasn’t just about feeling “calm” but about completely reframing how I relate to stress, productivity, and even failure.\n\nEventually, I put together a course based on what helped me and what I learned through formal training. It’s designed for people who *know* mindfulness is valuable, but have a hard time sticking with it or applying it to everyday stress. If that sounds like you, I’d be happy to share more or answer questions.\n\nNo pressure, just wanted to contribute something that’s helped me and might help someone else. 🙏",

In our often ridiculously busy modern world we are often complaining about the lack of “me time” or desperate for time to “just do me” for a little bit. I find myself doing this often when it feels like there is always just one more chore to do before I can rest. \n\nWhat I has become obvious to me is that, yes, our lives are incredibly busy today perhaps well beyond the limit of healthy. However, I believe the more mindful we can become the more we realize that each and every moment can be “me time”. Not only can every moment be “me time”, it is only in our mental perspective that it is not “me time”. If we pay attention fully while we drive our car, fold our laundry, wash the dishes we see that this is all just a constant expanding of what we see as self. It is not only “me time” when we are laying in bed, going for a hike, watching TV or typing on Reddit. It is still “me time” when I am getting a child ready for school or even at work. It’s all our time and the only time we will get.  \n\nIf we fail to see every moment as our own time, we are sacrificing the only thing we are guaranteed for a limited time: our own life, our own experience of existing. It is a powerful experience to realize that even when we are doing activities we would rather not be doing or feel to exhausted for this is IT. This is our life, our existence and our treasure. One day, this will end. Despite our myriad beliefs and hopes for what may or may not come after THIS is all we *know* we have. Don’t waste it by assigning huge chunks of your life as the kid’s or the boss’ or the parent’s time. It is your time. \n\nStay mindful and you will own so much more of your own story.",

    "text": "Curious about how light might support mindful states Over the past few years I’ve been exploring how different sensory inputs - especially light and rhythm - might help people settle into a more mindful, present state.\n\nMy team and I have been experimenting with a technique where rhythmic pulses of light are viewed through closed eyes. It’s based on the science of brainwave entrainment - using external rhythms to help the brain shift into more relaxed or aware states, like alpha and theta. The experiences people describe range from enhanced body awareness and emotional stillness to deeply visual inner journeys.\n\nWe recently developed a wearable version of the tool called Lumenate Nova and just launched it on Kickstarter. That said, I’m posting not to pitch, but to open up a conversation. Has anyone else here tried using light, sound, or sensory tools to support mindfulness? What helped you go deeper into the present moment - especially on days when the mind resists?\n\nGrateful for any reflections, and for the thoughtful energy this community holds ✨",

    "text": "How to overcome Grief **Viktor Frankl** was a psychiatrist, therapist and holocaust survivor, author of:  ***Man's Search for Meaning.***\n\nIn this book Viktor shares his experiences as a prisoner, as a survivor and as a therapist. He learned to give meaning to his suffering and believes people always have a choice no matter the context.\n\n>“If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be suffering.\n\n>Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death.\n\n>**Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete**.”\n\nThis perspective seems bleak, how can somebody live knowing that suffering is inevitable, especially if the person is already suffering? Is there something we can do as humans to deal with it?\n\n>“The way in which a man accepts his fate and all of the suffering it entails… gives him ample opportunity – even under the most difficult circumstances – to **add a deeper meaning** to his life.”\n\nSome prisoners were kind even if it meant reducing their own survival chances. Guards would behave differently not because of their rank but because of their own personal choice.\n\nOne prisoner designed to serving food (the watery soup) for everybody remained fair and never gave more to his friends or used his position to gain any favours. That was his choice.\n\nViktor's choice was to help people's morale as much as he could, trying to survive not just for his family but for his work: Something nobody else could do. This was his purpose and his choices.\n\n>“We had to learn… that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather **what life expected from us**.\n\n>We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being **questioned by life** – daily and hourly…\n\n>Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to **find the right answer to its problems** and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\n\n>…therefore the meaning of life, **differ from man to man, and from moment to moment.**“\n\nAfter being released for captivity and coming back to his work as a therapist, he tells the story of a patient of his that lost her old mother due to illness. She was devastated and saw no reason to live anymore.\n\nViktor asked her how her mother would have felt if she was the one to die.\n\nThen, the woman realized how deeply her mother would suffer, due to how unexpected it would be. \n\nThe woman realized her own kids would suffer immensely too losing their mother.\n\n**She realized the meaning of her suffering** \n\nShe outlived her mother and suffered her loss, just so her mother doesn't have to. \n\nShe lives so she can raise her kids and be a mother.\n\n>A man who **becomes conscious of the responsibility** he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.",

    "text": "Life of distraction Hello everyone. I’ve been getting *back* into mindfulness after falling out of the practice for a few months. I’ve done this a few times and each time feels different, deeper and more meaningful, which is cool. I’ve been through a lot in life and I’m in a place where I’ve finally been able to let my guard down and it’s made the mindfulness/meditation practice so much cooler. \n\nThat’s all kind of beside the point though. I’ve been really putting some thought into how much distraction I have in my life and I’ve realized that I’ve basically gone through my entire life being distracted. This distraction is usually intentional and has gone on for so long I don’t even realize it. \n\nWhenever I have a task, responsibility or just going through my work day, I do everything as quickly as possible to I can go back to doing nothing. I think this “doing nothing” for me is just my time to distract myself. I *always* want to be distracted. \n\nI rush through work so I can go home, eat dinner as quickly as possible and then sit in front of the tv and watch hours of yewtube videos before going to sleep. Wake up the next day and do it all over again. I try to mountain bike at least twice a week and when it’s nice out I do a fair amount of hiking. Other than that, I’m just bored and looking to be distracted. \n\nSo I’m practicing mindfulness now and I know it’s not good to go through life like this but I genuinely don’t know what to do. People say join a club, there are no clubs I’m interested in. Everything is boring…*everyone* is boring. It’s all just boring. The only time I’m not bored is when I’m distracted, hiking or biking. \n\nWhat do people do? What am I supposed to do?",

I just finished a 6 month mindfulness meditation program with [Halo Journey](https://www.halojourney.com/) and honestly, I feel so much lighter and more peaceful.

You’ll think random things like, *“Wait, wasn’t Joy the name of that movie character?”* Totally normal.\n* Whenever that happens, just smile, notice it, and gently bring your attention back to “peace” and “joy.”\n* Over time (around 2 months), you work your way up to sitting for 30 minutes without getting pulled away by thoughts.\n* Once you’re able to calm the mind like that, you move to the next stage: stop repeating words and simply watch your breath.\n* Focus on the feeling of air moving in and out of your nostrils. Then gradually expand your focus to sensations around your upper lip, and eventually across your whole body.\n* You start to notice that your entire body feels like waves or vibrations - everything is constantly changing.\n* That’s when it really clicks: sensations, thoughts, emotions - they all just come and go. Nothing’s permanent.\n* And slowly, you learn to just let thoughts pass without clinging or pushing them away.\n\nIt’s been such a grounding experience for me.",

    "text": "Meditation Techniques to Cultivate Sharp and Unwavering Focus For improving focus, you want to dedicate at least 20 (preferably 30) continuous minutes per day to a practice that specifically builds focus. \n\nPractices that build focus start very easy, and they come in different varieties. For starters, we have:\n\nA) Trataka: there are many variants, but I like the candle-gazing version. Simply maintain a soft gaze as you focus on the blue flames portion of a candle. To the best of your abilities, do not blink. Try to last as long as you can without blinking. If you do blink, focus on the after image with closed eyelids until that fades away. Then, reopen your eyes and keep looking at the brightest blue point of the candle flame. Do not strain or struggle. If you are swarmed with thoughts, your eyes will tire, and you will blink. Breathe deeply in and out. Relax fully, and keep the candle at a distance equal to two arms length away from you. You can also use yantras or a single black dot on a white sheet of paper. Again, there are many variants, and you can add body scans as well.\n\nB) Shavayatra (61-points): This is a quick body scan through specific marma points of the body. It will help focus your awareness on different parts of the body that have high concentrations of nerve centers, and it will promote the flow of energy. It will also help with relaxation and gaining insights. Do three rounds of the practice back-to-back, and you will be able to refine your concentration in two weeks. Once you know the sequence, you can self-guide with ease for even more benefits.\n\nC) Counting breaths backwards from 27, 54, or 108 to zero or 1: While focusing on the sensations at the brow center or the center of the forehead along with the breath, you will count each breath. Breathing in 27 and breathing out 27, breathing in 26 and breathing out 26, etc. If you make a mistake, lose count, or reach zero or one, you start the countdown back at 27, 54, or 108. To strengthen your focus even more, you can use mental alternate nostril breathing to become aware of the flow of breath in and out of one nostril at a time.\n\nD) Ajapa Japa: This is a mantra repetition practice that culminates with the mantra spontaneously repeating itself, effortlessly. There are a few variations and levels.\n\nE) Kirtan Kriya: This one is a Kundalini Yoga practice that will restore working memory, and it can help with focus, although a bit more slowly than the other concentration practices. You practice for 11, 32, or 62 minutes per day, depending on how much time you have. You repeat the mantras Sa-Ta-Na-Ma as you press each respective finger against your thumbs somewhat firmly but without too much force. The mantras are first changed aloud, then in a whisper, and then silently. Then, you restart the whisper and finish the practice chanting then aloud. Meanwhile, you are visualizing a golden L made of light continuously sweeping away all mental debris as it enters the crown of your head and exits the center of your forehead. In 40 days, your memory will be considerably sharper if you practice for 32 minutes each day.\n\nF) Vishoka Meditation: This practice contains many preparatory steps, and in stage one, the goal is to restore and strengthen the breath so as to unite the forces of breath and mind to heal the mind and return it to its optimal state. This one requires developing an optimal diaphragmatic breath with Makarasana, sandbag breathing to strengthen your diaphragm, some breath-aligned asanas to awaken your body and help you notice the subtle flows of energy, a relaxation practices to develop inner awareness of the space of the body, meditative pranayama to purify the energy channels of the body and remove pauses in the breath tied to lingering emotions, and shifting focus along the body in discrete jumps versus continuous flows while maintaining breath awareness in order to begin the main practice.  This practice helps you cultivate flow states that last for hours.",

Like the fingers on a hand, each unique in size and function, we possess distinct characteristics, talents and experiences. \n\nHowever, this unity can be undermined by a focus on personal gain. The moment the question \"What Will I Get?” takes precedence, it can breed competition and transactional pursuits, potentially leading to discord. \n\nTo truly be in sync with the world around us, we might consider transcending this self-centered perspective. In this critical era, the need for sensible, conscious individuals working together in harmony is paramount for the well-being of our planet.

Life’s been a whirlwind lately, and I’ve been leaning into this one practice that’s been a game-changer for staying grounded. It’s super simple: the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. When I’m overwhelmed, I pause and notice 5 things I see, 4 I can touch, 3 I hear, 2 I smell, and 1 I taste. It’s like hitting the reset button on my mind, bringing me back to the present moment.\n\nTried it this morning during a stressful work call—focused on my coffee mug, the texture of my desk, birds chirping outside, and the lingering taste of my breakfast. Total shift in energy. 🧘‍♀️\n\nWhat’s your go-to way to stay mindful when life gets wild? Share below—I’d love to try your techniques! 💚 #Mindfulness #StayPresent",

I know that she didn't literally mean that everything I think is false, but I have no idea what she actually *did* mean. I'm assuming that she meant my more emotionally oriented thoughts are false, but even this doesn't make sense.\n\nFor example: I think \"regardless of whether I become incredibly successful, or become homeless and die in a gutter, the universe will look exactly the same in a billion years.\" Now of course I don't mean that every atom and photon will be in the exact same state regardless of what I do, but that it will make no noticeable difference. How is this false? Or when I think \"It doesn't actually matter whether I eat food today; the pain of hunger is an experience that my mind labels as 'bad', but that's just an irrational bias because it doesn't matter in a broader sense whether one random human happens to have lower blood sugar than it usually does.\" This one is an opinion since the idea of something \"mattering\" is not objectively true or untrue, but it IS factually true that experiences are inherently neutral and are only assigned value by people's minds.\n\nIt's really confusing to me, because these are the kinds of thoughts she was talking about, and the parts that make statements about objective reality ARE true.",

    "text": "How I took control of my life as a Tech worker and as a Father. I loved my work as a Product Manager, but the shift to remote work following COVID brought significant changes. I found myself feeling anxious, depressed, and constantly run-down. Compounding this, we had a baby on the way, making it increasingly challenging to balance everything. My mind felt muddled, sleep became elusive, and life grew difficult.\n\nMeditation and breathwork had always interested me, and they offered moments of calm amidst the chaos. I threw myself into finding solutions: waking at 5 AM for walks, joining a gym, exploring various breathing exercises, using apps like Insight Timer, Calm, and Headspace, and even completing a Vipassana meditation retreat.\n\nDespite these efforts, I struggled to maintain the demanding routines these practices often require. Missing sessions only led to guilt, worsening the cycle. Eventually, I hit a breaking point and knew I needed a career break purely to focus on restoring my mental health.\n\nDuring this break, I began experimenting differently, adopting practices that fit my life and letting go of those that didn't. In hindsight, I realized that simpler, more integrated meditation and breathwork practices were the key.\n\nHere's what truly made the difference for me:\n\n-Starting the day with realistic expectations: I realized the intense pressure I put on myself regarding work and time was a major source of stress. I consciously decided that achieving one sm all win each day--anything from a walk with my child to completing a short online tutorial--would be enough.\n\n- Reducing phone time significantly: I noticed the negative impact of constant scrolling and context switching triggered by my smartphone feeds (Instagram, Reddit, Twitter). Shifting some activities, like deeper content consumption, to my laptop immediately improved my mental well-being by reducing context shifts.\n\n- Integrating short meditation/breathwork sessions throughout the day: This brought the most significant relief. I started incorporating multiple 5-minute sessions daily, sometimes briefly excusing myself from conversations to recenter with a quick breathing exercise. This practice helped me stay calmer and more resilient against mood swings.\n\n- Identifying and preparing for challenging situations: After practicing these techniques for about a month, I became better at recognizing situations likely to trigger stress. I began preparing beforehand--for instance, doing a quick breathing exercise right before a potentially stressful meeting helped keep me grounded.\n\n- Ending the day with a reflective walk: I started taking short evening walks (2-3 km) accompanied only by light music, allowing my mind to reflect on the day.\n\nI am super interested in knowing what worked out for you? How do you schedule your hectic day to find calm and peace in between? How do you stay mindful in your day to day life? How are you accomodate mindful practices amidst all the chaos that a busy life brings?\n\nEdit: Formatting",

He’s always referencing studies, and that sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole to see what’s emerging in current research.\n\nOne study I came across recently by Mount Sinai dives into how long-term meditation practice impacts deep brain structures like the amygdala and hippocampus—basically, the parts of the brain tied to memory processing and emotional regulation.\n\nWhat stood out to me wasn’t just the confirmation that these areas change—but that the researchers noted increased connectivity patterns that could explain why sustained meditation leads to more lasting emotional stability (not just the short-term calm we all know). It’s fascinating to see studies mapping what we’ve felt intuitively for years—that deep shifts are happening far beyond surface-level relaxation.\n\nI’m curious if anyone here has been following newer research in this space too—or noticed things in your own practice that seem to line up with these deeper neurological changes?

    "text": "Can Mindfulness Truly Help with Generalized Anxiety? Seeking Real Experiences Before Turning to Medication Hi everyone,\nI’ve been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder for some time, but I prefer alternative approaches whenever possible. I exercise regularly, eat well, and try to maintain a healthy social life. Unfortunately, lately it hasn’t been enough.\n\nBefore turning to medication, I’d really like to give meditation a serious try — especially mindfulness practices. In your experience, can mindfulness significantly improve or even replace medication for anxiety? I’d love to hear from those who’ve been down this path.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I believe that breath watching is the only true form of meditation- breath isn’t just an object but is the answer and only way to truly meditate and become more aware, I’ve understood this through experience of practicing breath watching all day(whatever I’m doing even talking or eating ). Now I don’t necessarily mean the air through the nostrils but just any sensation u feel of breath in the body, and that being the truth. Breath is spirit. I truly believe breath is the answer, not in any particular breath work or way or breathing but simply the act of watching/noticing/feeling it. Now I know lots of people will disagree saying it’s only 1 object but I believe it’s the only true way to enlightenment. Would love to hear if any of you are like minded in this way and we can discuss more. Thanks",

    "text": "The Architecture of Focus Hello,\n\nI'm sharing a preprint of my article, \"The Architecture of Focus,\" and would be very grateful for your perspectives on it, particularly as it relates to the concepts we often discuss here regarding awareness and attention.\n\nIn this paper, I propose a unified model of attention centered around the idea of \"focal energy\" – a volitionally deployed cognitive force that structures our awareness. Instead of viewing attention solely as a selective filter (the traditional \"spotlight\" metaphor), this framework suggests it's an active process that shapes how we experience and engage with both internal and external stimuli through its placement, intensity, density, and stability on our conscious field.\n\nThe model also introduces the \"constellation model\" of focus, which envisions attention as a distributed network of concentrated awareness rather than a single point, potentially offering a new way to understand how we can be aware of multiple things simultaneously.\n\nGiven the deep connection between mindfulness practice and the cultivation of focused awareness, I'm particularly interested in how these concepts resonate with your experiences and understanding of attention in meditation and daily life. Does the idea of \"focal energy\" structuring awareness align with how you perceive your focus shifting and settling? Does the \"constellation model\" offer a useful lens for understanding the breadth and focus of your awareness during practice?\n\nThe article is currently available as a preprint on my [Academia.edu](http://Academia.edu) profile, where you can access the full text. I'm seeking feedback to refine it, and your insights would be greatly appreciated.",

She has also dabbled into energy healing, astro and is trained in yoga and meditation. \nRecently, I helped her set up her own little online classes, and since I was helping - I was always logged on during the 30 minutes of her ‘Unwind Session’ - where a community together does breathing, gentle relaxing exercises and a short meditation. \n\nUnknowingly, I realised that just the meditation playing in the background helped in some ways. I’ve always found it really hard to be mindful, specially because my mind is generally always so full that I hate stopping and being aware. After a while, I started subconsciously joining in to one two of her instructions also - the deep breathe in and breathe out. \n\nI know that mindfulness is all about being aware and present but if you’re unable to do it actively, try it passively.

One of a new cue that I’ve been following is the cue of “just don’t hold the breath”. Now let me explain what this means and why it’s useful. What it’s doing is keeping ur attention on breath as ur not trying to hold the breath so ur essentially just watching it / allowing the breath really. If u find urself holding it then that’s ok just watch that and watch ur body breath again. So it’s not in the literal sense where ur like not holding it as u can’t control that physically, the cue is intending you to essentially maintain a continual watching/ allowing which is much easier throughout the day and literally takes up little to no cognitive resource, allowing u to do this all day regardless of what ur doing (talking studying driving working etc). You may say, well why not have “breath watching all day” as the cue then? Well that’s a good point but i think this “just don’t hold ur breath” is simpler and makes it easier to do all throughout the day besucase its not really about consciously guiding the breath or in and out breath, but really just allowing it , maintaining attention but not in a cognitive way if that makes sense I really love this practice and what to see if anyone is like minded and is doing soemthing similar and can explain what I mean",

It invites humility, not because we’re right or wrong, but because we’re willing to expand.\n\nI’ve found that too much self-importance tends to shrink awareness. But the more space I give others, the more space I find in myself too.\n\nThis might sound abstract, so here are a few small ways I’ve been trying to practice it:\n\n• Pausing before I react, especially when I feel defensive\n\n• Asking, “What might they be feeling that I can’t see?”\n\n• Observing more, judging less, even if it’s just while waiting in line\n\n• Noticing when I assume, and gently challenging that assumption\n\n• Letting go of needing to be right, and choosing to stay curious instead\n\nNone of it’s perfect.

    "text": "Replacing Attention's Flashlight with A Constellation As part of a unified model of attention I propose the spotlight metaphor isn't quite correct to reflect the brain's true parallel processing capabilities. Instead I think a constellation metaphor is more appropriate. The constellation is described as a network of active nodes of concentrated awareness distributed across perceptual-cognitive fields.\n\nEach node varies in intensity, area on the conscious field it covers and dynamically engages with other nodes in the constellation.\n\nExample - watching a movie - External active nodes: visual to watch screen, auditory to listen, kinesthetic (sensory) feeling cushion of seat (dim node), kinesthetic (motor) node activates to eat popcorn, interoceptive node activates if we notice hunger or feeling of need to urinate, kinesthetic (motor) node for breath which is an ever present but very dim node in the constellation. Internal nodes relate to comprehending the movie, analyzing the plot, forming opinions of characters, predicting next events etc...\n\nDoes this make sense??? I am looking for feedback.\n\n[Here is a link](https://www.academia.edu/128743359/The_Architecture_of_Focus) to an article that doesn't solely focus on the constellation model but describes a bit more detail in the 2nd half of the article. I posted this article recently on another post",

I’ve been posting 2-3 videos a day, each inspired by the natural world—rain, thunder, ocean waves, and even city sounds. It has been super exciting 🥰\n\nFor me, soundscapes have always helped to clear my head or even just help me relax after a long day. So I wanted to share my channel with anyone else who finds peace in nature’s rhythms or even in everyday sound. I’m always open to feedback, so please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to hear! I love putting these videos together and making them pieces of art and love 💕\n\nSo if that sounds like something you would enjoy or even a friend, or family member would enjoy, my YT channel is skycreations333, it should have cherry blossoms as the banner cover of the account 🌿\n\nSending you all love and blessings and thank you for allowing me to share this with you all ☺️",

    "text": "Help! How important is focusing on a single thing? Hey all!\n\nI've been meditating daily for about a year now and love it.\n\nNow a friend wants to get started to help them overcome anxiety and want to give them the best advice I can. \n\nFor me I couldn't get a grip on mindfulness at all for ages. It was only when I developed my ability to pay attention to a single thing (started with sounds, then moved onto the breath) that I feel I really \"got\" mindfulness and was able to start feeling like I could do it. Before that I just got horribly tangled in my thoughts - couldn't work out what I was doing and felt rubbish doing it. Fell into analysing thoughts and arguing with myself.\n\nInstinctively with my friend i'd advise the same thing. Set a timer, focus on a single sensation daily, in time you'll get there. After a few weeks of daily single pointed focus and finding your feet, then start introducing mindfulness, and the ability to keep track of your mind as it floats more freely. But is this right?\n\nI'm new to this sub (i'm a big fan of the mind illuminated and meditation subs). Are there people here who would say single pointed attention is not necessary, that you just crack on with mindfulness and observe and accept all sensations no matter what they be? I get that you CAN and I understand how to do that.\n\nBut really did that work for lots of you, without first developing stable attention on a single meditation object?\n\nI get that everyone is different and perhaps that's the answer... But would love a straw poll!\n\nThanks!",

There’s a difference between loneliness and solitude I didn’t always understand.\n\nWhen I didn’t know myself, when I didn’t like sitting with my own thoughts, being alone felt like something was missing. I needed someone else to distract me from the quiet. That kind of loneliness felt heavy, like waiting for something that never arrived.\n\nBut over time, through stillness and small daily habits, something shifted. I started to enjoy my own company. Solitude became less about isolation and more about peace.\n\nSome things that helped:\n\n- Going for short walks without my phone. \n\n- Eating one meal a day in silence. \n\n- Sitting with my breath for five minutes, no expectations. \n\n- Writing down one honest thought before bed. \n\nThese little moments helped me notice what I’d been running from. And eventually, they helped me realize I wasn’t really alone at all.\n\nCurious if anyone else has felt that shift, from needing someone, to just needing stillness.",

    "text": "Realising I come across entirely differently on video to how I feel I come across in person and wonder if anyone relates? \n\n\nSo just to start this off. I used to have really bad social anxiety. I’ve done a lot of work over the years and basically completely eradicated it to the point where I now feel confident. However parts still remain. The story will explain the parts that do. \n\nSo I was doing a house tour today for my sister. I took a video of it. \n\nOne issue that remains for me is that I am very empathetic and can pretty much feel what everyone feels or notice when people are anxious. \n\nThe issue with this is when I talk and converse with people I often analyse their facial expressions subconsciously and it makes me see their anxieties and sometimes I shift that onto myself assuming they are uncomfortable because of something I’ve caused when I’ve given them no reason to be) or I just view a neutral facial expression as anxious one. \n\nI know this isn’t true in reality and that I’m just protecting their emotions and struggles onto myself, one cause of feeling empathy and that’s what empaths do and two because it’s linked to my old anxiety struggles where I assumed I was the problem even tho I rationally know now that all humans struggle and I’m just picking up on their emotions. \n\nIs there a way to stop feeling this and just be present in the moment? I am confident for the most part but stuff still creeps in. \n\nI had little fleeting thoughts during the house tour like ‘I didn’t speak much’, kept thinking I needed to ask more questions etc. \n\nHowever when I got home and watched the video tour I took back. I realised that I was carrying the conversation. Asking loads of questions and making people laugh and feel at ease and also sounded confident and assured throughout. My friends always tell me this is my character also that I make people feel at ease, yet my mind can tell me differnt things. \n\nBasically. I clearly overthink a lot in the moment and the video proved that I was entirely different to what I imagined in my head and doing all the opposite things to what I assumed. \n\nI deffo DID used to be awkward even on video and that would show. But now it’s the complete opposite and I seem confident on video but I don’t always feel 100% confident of my abilities in person socialising and set my standards very high. \n\nWhat can I do about this that doesn’t mean I film every interaction I ever have lol. I want to be assured I did a good job in person as the video proves that I come across as confident and sure of myself. I just want to 100% know and feel that inside that it was a good interaction in person as the video proved it was instead of assuming it wasn’t. \n\nAny tips welcome!\n\nThank you :)",

    "text": "What if we were books or movies? Thoughts on the meaning of life… “Borges taught us that nothing is new, that creation is re-creation, that we are all one contradictory mind, connected amongst each other and through time and space, that human beings are not only fiction makers but are fictions themselves, that everything we think or perceive is fiction, that every corner of knowledge is a fiction.”\n\n***This interpretation appears in a 2014 BBC Culture article by Jane Ciabattari, which paraphrases the ideas of Suzanne Jill Levine, a distinguished translator and Borges scholar.\n\nThis made me pause and reflect on life, on human existence, and on the strangeness of this reality we’re all part of. Because I’ve also noticed that almost every great story, whether in a novel or a film, follows a similar pattern, just as outlined in Save the Cat by Jessica Brody and Blake Snyder (a popular guide for storytellers, with versions for both screenwriters and novelists).\n\nThere’s always a flawed protagonist, burdened by problems and inner contradictions. There’s conflict: external and internal. The classic tension of want vs need: the character relentlessly pursues what they want, all while avoiding what they need most.\n\nThen comes the Midpoint, when things shift. The “bad guys” close in—whether they’re actual villains or painful life circumstances. Eventually, it all falls apart. We reach the infamous \"All is Lost\" moment, followed by the Dark Night of the Soul, when everything feels hopeless, and the character must confront who they really are. Their inner truth. As painful and ugly as it might be. \n\nBut then, something changes. There’s a spark of insight, the beginning of inner transformation. The character chooses growth. They rise, not by escaping their flaws but by facing them. That’s the real climax. The victory isn’t just external—it’s internal.\n(Setup. Catalyst. Debate. Break into Act Two. Fun and Games. Midpoint. Bad Guys Close In. All is Lost. Dark Night of the Soul. Break into Act Three. Finale. Final Image.)\n\nAnd here’s what I’ve been thinking: if every truly resonant story follows this arc, maybe it’s because deep down, we feelthat this is how life works. Even ancient myths and fairy tales reflect it.\n\nMaybe we instinctively recognize a “good” story not because of how it entertains us, but because it mirrors the soul’s journey. And that makes me wonder: perhaps this reality, our lives, is less about happiness and comfort than we’d like to believe, and more about growth, change, and transformation.\n\nThere’s joy, yes. There are periods of happiness. There are moments of beauty and love and warmth. But the structure, the core, is about evolving. \nI’m still not sure how I feel about this revelation 🫣🤣\n\nWhat do you think about this concept?",

    "text": "I feel that the definition of mindfulness is ambiguous. What is the exhaustive definition of mindfulness? Mindfulness is usually defined as being aware without judgement, so being aware of your thoughts, feelings, sensory input, etc. So, being mindful in this moment is noticing, and without judgement, my fingers touching the keys on the keyboard, and the thoughts in my head as I'm writing this post.\n\nBut, a problem I have had is maintaining awareness in things that require attention, things that you need to really let yourself go into. Basically, the flow state. Like, let's say you do a combat sport, doing a difficult problem, or just watching a movie. It's hard to really do these things to the best of your ability while you are being aware like before. When I'm sparring or competing in jiujitsu, my mind is not at all thinking about what I am seeing without judgement. So flow seems like the opposite of mindfulness, because I am not aware of the present moment, or at least not as aware as I would've been in a calmer moment. \n\nBut then people will say, \"Flow is mindfulness\", because you are completely lost in an activity with no distractions. I don't understand this. It seems like the definition has changed from \"aware of the present moment without judgement\" to \"not being distracted from the activity you are doing\". And these do not seem like the same thing at all. Being aware of the present moment is a lot of the times distractive to the the activity, and being immersed in an activity does not always mean you are being aware. For example, would we really call doom scrolling reels, shorts, or tiktoks mindful because you are so sucked in that you aren't being distracted from anything else?",

    "text": "Is detachment the best way to rid yourself of limiting beliefs? Hey everyone! I've been reflecting lately on something that's been a recurring theme in my personal growth journey – the way I have been and sometimes continue to often be my own biggest roadblock without even realizing it, usually through negative self-talk. \n\nIt struck me during a guided meditation some time ago that we adopt dominant mental thought processes that dictate what we believe is possible for ourselves.\n\nIt’s so important to catch ourselves when we’re setting barriers or limits on ourselves. Taking a neutral position is a good way forward. Not getting too high or too low. I feel like we always come up with a reason why we can’t do or achieve something in our lives, when in reality, we have no idea and we shouldn’t determine that beforehand. This is where mindfulness comes in and is so powerful. \n\nOver time, i’ve noticed more and more how easily these limiting beliefs blend into our identity. They don't announce themselves. They don't wear name tags saying \"I'm a limiting belief!\" Instead, they masquerade as rational thought, practical wisdom, and these thoughts are truly only there to protect us from the unknown. \n\nI've been journaling about this pattern and noticed something interesting: whenever I approach the edge of my comfort zone, a very particular internal dialogue kicks in. It's subtle and not the obvious \"you can't do this\", but it’s more like a reminder of my past or the thought of what could go wrong. \n\nI'm here once again, humbly, to share my art and to also get your opinions. Does anyone else notice these specific thought patterns of limiting beliefs for themselves? **And more importantly, have you found effective ways to recognize them in real-time?** \n\n[**The Hidden Wall Between You and Your Potential**](https://youtu.be/OHq2i0yap6Y)\n\nWhat I'm experimenting with now is a simple question: \"Where did I learn this assumption?\" Sometimes tracing it back to its origin helps me see how unreasonable some of these beliefs really are. Often they're just echoes of something I internalized during a vulnerable moment, or a conclusion I jumped to after a negative experience.\n\nI’d pose that the challenging part isn't identifying these thoughts, it's about creating new mental pathways that feel genuinely authentic rather than just positive thinking layered on top of deep doubt. That never helps.\n\n**Would you say that detaching from limiting beliefs is the best avenue forward?** \n\nI'd love to hear about your experiences. What hidden assumptions have you discovered were holding you back? And what practices have helped you make changes?\n\nSometimes I think half the battle is just knowing we're not alone in this strange, beautiful life.",

    "text": "Help, The World Is On Fire If you're reading this, there is a chance that you may feel that there is something wrong with the world, the world or my country is an awful place, or the future looks bleak. I'm going to call it \"the world\", but you could call it \"reality\" or \"the way things are\" or \"people\" or \"the government\" or just about anything else because all of these things are the same type of abstractions that are, if you examine them closely, nothing more than a reflection of your own beliefs, which you have learned from others or from the media over the course of your life. But let's call it the world for now, and let's look deeply at the world as a concept.\n\nWhat you believe is the world is really just a collection of beliefs, ideas, and descriptions. In other words, a collection of thoughts, neatly put together so that you can categorize it. You could say the world is the product of thoughts. But reality is not your thoughts, and your thoughts are not reality. Reality is here and now. Nothing more, nothing less. Reality is what is concretely here, as you are experiencing it. We could also say that both the past and the future are the same type of abstraction as the world because they exist only as thoughts in the moment you are thinking them. But we can go down that road another time.\n\nGiven how depressing the news has been and how much it's been bothering people, let's look at the news now, purely from an objective point of view. The news often makes people miserable, anxious, angry, uncomfortable. You're already well aware of all the possibilities of bias, skewed points of view, the possibility that some news will not get reported and other news will get overreported and blown up out of proportion. Any way you look at it, there is no way that the news story you read can completely and fully capture the situation it is reporting on. It is merely a story about a very small portion of what happened at a particular point in time. And more often than not, it's usually not a very good one, interjecting subjective opinions and changing the story to make it more exciting and interesting so that you'll read it and engage with it. But regardless of its actual quality, you regard it as the truth, and so that story gets added to your concept of \"the world\" and what's going on in it.\n\nBut even if we throw away the arguments of abstraction and simply look at what we read in the news as reality, they still cannot represent the whole truth. They are a small portion of the truth, and in some cases they are not true at all. But if you believe them to be true, they become true to you. And these thoughts get added to your worldview, even if they are incomplete, or incorrect entirely. You believe them, and that becomes part of your concept of the world. It becomes your truth. And the moment you understand the roots of your beliefs and thoughts, you may want to consider very deeply examining your own beliefs and the thoughts that are behind them.\n\nSo if you look very deeply into the world, you will see that it is nothing more than an abstraction, a concept, a series of thoughts. You could simplify even further and say that words are thoughts and thoughts are words, because if any words are to be understood, they are to be internalized and converted into thoughts. So you could say if it is a word, it is a thought, and a thought is nothing but words - because it takes thinking to understand words, and it takes words to understand thinking.\n\nThe problem however is not with words. Words can be a fantastic tool to communicate. The problem is that we mistake these words for reality, and they're not. They're just words. Concepts. Thoughts.\n\nReality is what is all around you, what surrounds you, here and now. Concepts, words, and thoughts are not reality. If I were to say show me your thoughts, what would you show me to prove that they are real?\n\nIf you're following along to this point and really deeply considering what I'm saying, it might occur to you that what you think is reality isn't reality at all, it is merely thoughts. Thoughts that are shaped and skewed by the person expressing them, then shaped and skewed by you, and then adopted by you. They are a subjective fragmentation of what is real, a signpost that has no meaning other than to point to the thing that is real. But we still keep reading the signposts and mistake them for what they are pointing to.\n\nIf you think the world is on fire and you want your suffering to end, it's time you take a very close examination of what is real and what is an abstraction. And if you look very closely, very objectively, you will find that most of what you think is real is merely a concept or thought. And any way you look at it, your thoughts are not reality. Reality is reality - that is to say, what is concrete, here and now, is reality.\n\nYou can't see your thoughts, you can't feel them, you can't even hear them because that would imply that they are picked up by your ears, and they are not. You are living in a world of abstractions, and those abstractions are very much subjective, and can change at any time for any reason. Thoughts cannot be the fundamental objective reality because thoughts in and of themselves are neither objective nor real.\n\nYour thoughts may have thoroughly convinced you that those thoughts are reality, and other people may have thoroughly convinced you that those thoughts are reality (because that is their truth, because they believe it). But if you examine this idea deeply, you'll find for yourself that it simply can't be true.\n\nBut please don't just believe me. After all, that's how we got into this mess in the first place isn't it? It's up to you to discover this on your own by going deeper into your own beliefs as you discover them. By discovering when you're deep in thinking, recognizing that it's just a thought, and reminding yourself of the true nature of reality which is here and now. It may be difficult, uncomfortable, even agonizing depending on how attached you are to your beliefs and thoughts.\n\nBut if you're tired of suffering, if you're tired of \"reality\" or the way things are, if you want to find the truth for yourself rather than just remaining comfortable in an illusion, I think it's worth it, isn't it?",

Now I celebrate breaking the cycle. 💔➡️💛 For years, Mother’s Day was a painful reminder.  \nWhile others were posting photos and sweet memories, I felt a deep, quiet ache.  \nBecause my experience wasn’t flowers and love — it was walking on eggshells, being blamed, manipulated, ignored, or smothered.\n\nIt took me years to even feel *neutral* about Mother’s Day.  \nThe guilt, the grief, the confusion… it’s heavy when your mother was supposed to protect you, but instead became the source of your deepest wounds.\n\nBut something changed.  \nNow I’m a mother too.  \nAnd this day means something entirely different to me.\n\nI don’t celebrate *her*.  \nI celebrate the fact that I’ve broken the cycle.  \nThat I’ve done the inner work, that I’ve healed enough to show up differently — with tenderness, with presence, with unconditional love.  \nNot perfectly. But *consciously*.\n\nTo anyone out there struggling today:  \nYou’re allowed to grieve the parent you never had.  \nYou’re allowed to feel numb, angry, sad, or relieved.  \nYou’re allowed to *not* celebrate.\n\nAnd you’re allowed to heal.  \nTo let go of what never was.  \nTo become the safe, loving presence — for yourself, or for your children — that you never received.\n\nI put some healing resources in my profile that helped me a lot, in case it supports someone else too.  \nYou’re not alone in this. Sending love today, especially if this day feels complicated. 💛",

    "text": "How do you let yourself just flow while not getting extremely lost in details? So I used to practice this a few years back, and last month I felt like practicing again because my DPDR got super bad. \n\nI know how to focus on sensations and be consistent on it, but I just found a new fear last week that still persists that I can't get to calm by any means. \n\nFor more context, beside DPDR I have pure OCD, so my brain is constantly messy with thoughts and everything... Also, I'm a musician and I work as a composer, so I usually have to stay focused on a task for hours with a lot of attention to details.\n\nBut now, I feel like I don't know how to just flow with music, life experiences (eating, hanging out...) because I'm afraid to get lost in details and not be present on the full picture. Like for example, I can deeply notice nuances on an instrument during a song, or details inside a body sensation, but I don't feel the 'whole thing'. What is the point of eating if you're not enjoying your food while flavoring it? Like, you can focus on how the food looks and not how it tastes.\n\nI don't know if I'm able to lower the size of my attention span, I just want to feel things normally and not get too lost on the details. You don't need to go that far. As I don't know how important this is and what to use as an \"object of meditation\", I get lost in anxiety and thoughts too, so it gets even harder to just feel present and \"be\". I'm struggling really hard and rn I can't afford to pay to my therapist for more payed guidance. I need to understand this better on my own (as I have done with multiple things and successfully) to get a little relief on what's happening in my mind.\n\nTL;DR:\nI feel I'm doing wrong by noticing on details, like... What if I just focus in details when distracting myself from anxiety and totally forget about just feeling a song? A concert?.... Where do I put the limit if I can even do that? What do I do with focusing on details of sensations overall?",

    "text": "Mindfulness means awareness and we are that, already inherent in us and our nature and our natural state of Be-ing. It must be employed due to distraction of multivarious thoughts \n\n It is awareness that dispels distractive, destructive, intrusive, anxious, invasive thoughts which mindful being  or simply a witness of those thoughts is trying to achieve without identifying with them, judging, condemning those thoughts but simply being aware of them as a passing show.\n\nUnnecessary thoughts (over thinking) are the obstacle to your perception. It starts with simple awareness which will lead you to heightened awareness-consciousness already inherent in us and our natural state\n\nThis repeated awareness, and constantly bringing the mind back to its rightful place of awareness strengthens the mind which got weak due to its wanderings and cannot resist the temptations of distractive thoughts, but with persistence it can regain its composure and stick to one thought.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you've noticed yourself.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

    "text": "A more in-depth book about mindfulness/meditation that's more psychologically based rather than metaphorical Here are the conditions required for what I would consider to be a mindfulness book that is good enough. I used to have some OCD/anxiety in the past (still have it sometimes) and I started mindfulness about 2 years ago. (Last post I made was deleted because it “had large amounts of unformatted text.”)\n\n1. No pagan spirituality or genuine atheism. As a conservative Catholic, I recognize that meditation can have moral dangers, but usually not for mindfulness. I’m aware that the Buddha wasn’t exactly a religious founder like Mohammed, and so a lot of what’s called “Buddhist meditation” may not be spiritual in any meaningful sense. I’d be suspicious of things like talking to spirits or generating compassion for the Buddha or something like that. Also I wouldn’t want Buddha on the cover ideally. And I probably wouldn’t want it to have a large Buddhist undertone.\n\n2. Has to be more “scientifically based.” Not in the sense that it has to follow all the rigors of what’s considered “science”, but that it should be based on a careful understanding of cause and effect. Also, I’d like to mention that just focusing on your breath or something simple like that isn’t likely to give you all the benefits you need.\n\nSo far I’ve read “altered traits,” watched some Huberman videos, and I’m currently using Sam Harris’s meditation app. Nevertheless, they’re all imperfect to some degree. I’d like to dig deeper, but not watch 2 hour videos where you’re not sure what you’ve actually learned.",

For so long, I shaped myself around that.\n\nBut I’ve been single for the past three years, and during this time, I’ve grown closer to a woman in my life who I really admire. That connection has opened something in me. It’s changing how I see myself, relationships, and even the world around me. It feels like there’s a whole side of life I didn’t know existed — a life I didn’t realize I could actually live.\n\nAnd it’s not just about sexuality — this shift is affecting everything. I’ve started questioning my job, my studies, and what I even want from life. I’m thinking about switching directions entirely, maybe even applying for a completely different master’s program.

I feel lost and kind of scared.\n\nI still live at home, and that makes it harder — the pressure to stay within certain social norms is really strong. But at the same time, this change feels… honest.

Not the occasional stress kind, but the type that sits in your chest and makes even small things feel overwhelming. A lot of it came from trying to keep up—social pressure, school expectations, comparing myself to everyone online… it just felt like I was always falling short or running behind.\n\nMeditation wasn’t some magical fix, but it gave me a space where I didn’t have to be anything or prove anything. Just sit, breathe, and exist for a few minutes. That stillness became something I started to actually look forward to. It helped me notice my thoughts without getting caught up in them, and over time, I think it made a real difference. And now I am just curious what does meditation do for others.\n\nI often use some apps to help me to meditate and stay focused and I have tried other meditation apps like insight timer but I often found them to be too complicated and too hard to find the right track or function when you really need it. As part of a school project, I’ve been developing a simple meditation app designed to make mindfulness more accessible—whether you have 2 minutes or 20. It includes calming sounds, guided sessions, and a space to just *be*.  I have designed it to fit my needs and so that it's as simple to use as possible.\n\nIf you’re open to trying it out, I’d be incredibly grateful for your feedback. Your thoughts will help shape the app and make it better for everyone. \n\n[**Download app**](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6744267922?pt=127735317&ct=Meditatr%20sm&mt=8)\n\nSo tell me—what’s your reason to meditate?

The way we speak, the way we listen, the way we respond, or fail to respond to someone else’s unmet needs often mirrors how we treat our own discomfort, our own cry for help, our own pain. When we ignore, suppress, reject, or harshly judge our inner world, it can become easier to do the same with others.\n\nAnd yes, “sorry” really does seem to be the hardest word, especially when pride, fear, or old wounds stand in the way. Yet sometimes, the most difficult words to say are the very ones that open the door to healing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OXqw6ERK09o?si=vQpxpWKkOF-vst4_",

    "text": "Mindfulness Helped Me Stop Waiting to “Feel” Confident — I Just Started Acting I waited for years to feel ready. To feel confident. Time passed by faster and faster. I kept waiting for that something. I thought that one day I would wake up and finally have that unwavering confidence that everyone talks about.\n\nIt never came.\n\nThen I started practicing mindfulness not only in meditation, but also in my daily reactions. My mind was filled with things and unnecessary information, I started imagining things that would happen. They never did. I started to notice how much of my hesitation came from overthinking. From believing every fear-filled thought as truth.\n\nSo instead of waiting for confidence to come, I started acting on it. Small steps: walking taller, making eye contact, speaking even if my voice trembled. All those little things that would make me at least one percent better. At the same time, I started listening to silent, positive reminders in the background (subliminals). Not as a magic spell but as a way to retrain my attention. And then my brain started to reprogram itself.\n\nThat combination of awareness + action - changed everything.\n\nThe confidence didn't come before I started. It grew because I started. Once the confidence started it couldn't stop, today I do things I never thought I would have the courage to do.\n\nMy life has completely turned around and become better, just because I took that first step and stopped waiting.\n\n\n\nIf there are any of you who are currently in this situation, you are not alone, you should always know that. And it's just important to take the first step.",

    "text": "Mindfulness helped me quit smoking One week ago today I woke up and decided not to buy another pack of cigarettes. It felt random at the time. I woke up and told myself, treat it like an experiment and see if you can get through the day without any cigarettes. You can have nicotine gum if you want a dopamine hit, and you can take some deep breaths if you are craving a moment to de-stress.\n\nA month and a half ago I left an abusive relationship. Since then, I have been working to rewire my nervous system and practice mindfulness meditation to feel safe in my body again. Part of this has involved learning to drop in and listen to what my body is really asking of me, whether that be rest, a nourishing meal, a moment to breathe, etc.\n\nAnother part of healing has involved learning to love and respect myself through my actions. I started to realize that my relationship with cigarettes was a lot like the one with my abuser. I was addicted and choosing temporary comfort from the very thing that was causing me long term harm and damage.\n\nThe strangest thing is that when I woke up one week ago, all my desire for cigarettes had disappeared. I had tried to quit before but it was always such a struggle. But this time, all my inner work led to me deciding I was done treating myself like shit in the name of temporary comfort. If I was strong enough to leave my abuser then I sure as hell was strong enough to quit these nasty cigarettes! And I did, and I am very proud of myself :)\n\nMy main takeaway from this experience is that nervous system rewiring is incredibly powerful. It has taught me that if I slow down, breathe and stay curious, I actually can face difficult sensations and emotions. I don’t need to run from them or drown them out with substances and distractions. It feels like riding a wave, rather than fighting it.\n\nPerhaps this is obvious and elementary to others, but maybe we could all use this reminder from time to time. We are stronger than we realize and we can do hard things!",

    "text": "The Happiness to Just Be There is a happiness that comes to us naturally when we quiet down and just be. This is a different kind of joy from the happiness and excitement that comes from getting what we want. A greater joy comes when we can let go and just be with everything that is here.\n\nThen, when we begin to stay more and more in this joy, everything becomes easier, almost effortless. This is because we are no longer so fixated on trying to get everything to match exactly as we want. There is less anxiety about getting everything perfect. So we are starting to find a new freedom that doesn't have to rely on what is happening \"out there\". Life becomes easier because we are starting to become more in-tune with life, rather than resisting and grabbing at life's events. There is a gratitude that comes for no reason at all. We are grateful just to be.\n\nMany of us are in a 'waiting' state of mind, we are looking for something out there to fulfill us; we aren't happy with right now. From my experience, I've found that we can't find meaning in life by looking in the future, or hoping for something big enough to happen to fulfill us. I'm coming to see that life's meaning is to learn how to be. When I catch myself searching in some future, or losing myself in the past, I can see that I've already lost the simple joy that comes from being in the present. All that it takes to be happy again is to realize that we've gotten lost in a thought, and to come back to the world around us, which is the trees, the grass, the feeling of the floor on your feet, the breath, and stillness. Then with this presence, whatever we choose to do in the external world we can find ease, enjoyment, and purpose.",

    "text": "Extension of Depletion Theory I've been exploring how my model of attention can among other things, provide a novel lens for understanding ego depletion. In my work, I propose that voluntary attention involves the deployment of a mental effort that concentrates awareness on the conscious field (what I call 'expressive action'), and is akin to \"spending\" a cognitive currency. This is precisely what we are spending when we are 'paying attention'. Motivation, in this analogy, functions like a \"backing asset,\" influencing the perceived value of this currency.\n\nI suggest that depletion isn't just about a finite resource running out, but also about a *devaluation* of this attentional currency when motivation wanes. Implicit cognition cannot dictate that we \"pay attention\" to something but it can in effect alter the perceived value of this mental effort, and in turn whether we pay attention to something or not. This shift in perspective could explain why depletion effects vary and how motivation modulates self-control. I'm curious about your feedback on this \"attentional economics\" analogy and its potential to refine depletion theory.",

If it is here in front of you now, it is reality. **Everything else is entirely the product of your thoughts**. And as we discussed in previous posts, those thoughts are a phantom occurrence that cannot be seen or heard or touched, and so we can safely say that thoughts are not real. \n\nSo what are thoughts then? Thoughts are the product of language, which is something that you learned from others at an early age. Your parents pointed to a tree and said \"tree\". They pointed at you and said your name. And so you repeated back tree and knew it meant the tree. you repeated back your name and knew it meant you.\n\nAfter that you began to learn all sorts of other things entirely with words from other people, from family and friends and teachers, from books and tv shows and movies and the internet. You were given or had to deal with more and more complex problems, all of a sudden you had to learn words about words and concepts about concepts that became more and more complex, and you developed thinking in order to solve these things.\n\nAs you became an adult you had to rely more and more on thinking and concepts to drive a car, to go to college, to get a job and pay your taxes, to vote, to use technology. And so your thinking became more and more complex out of necessity, and if we only used thinking to solve these problems here and now it would never be a problem.\n\nBut of course thinking can't be so easily shut off when we don't want it. And so instead of using them for a practical purpose we allow our thoughts complete control over us, worrying about the future we don't know, endlessly dwelling on the past that is already over with, worrying about our selves which we somehow can't seem to change. \n\nAnd all the while it is perfectly useless to do so, and in the end the only result of all this thinking is leaving us anxious and frustrated and miserable here and now. And this happens because we forget the most basic fundamental thing about these words, which is that **the words are not the same as the thing that they represent**. \n\nWhen you're a young child you know that a tree is this thing that's in front of you. You don't confuse the word tree for the actual tree, because before you learned that word, it was simply here in front of you now. You knew what a tree was, but what it really was - not just the word for it. \n\nReality itself is incredibly simple, but as our lives get more and more complex, we get further and further from that reality. All because we confuse words with reality. That's it. Once you discover for yourself that reality is here and now, these words lose all their power over you. You can use those words when you need to, but you are free from their illusion.\n\nWhat happens after that is up to you.",

Today, I ran into a person who caused a large part of what I went through while I was in the store. I turned around and walked out. I wasn’t upset about what they did to me, or the situation, but I was just very annoyed. I talked to my friend about seeing this person and their reaction was to immediately tell me that I wasn’t over what they did since I left. Can anyone put their two cents in? Is being annoyed at the sight of them and leaving a sign I’m still stuck on it? Or can you be healed and still have that reaction? Interested to hear people’s thoughts.",

I can only keep it going for a few seconds at a time, but I am working to stay in it longer.  When I enter into this mindfulness state, there is a physical feeling that accompanies it.

That’s not just you, it’s your brain doing exactly what it evolved to do.\n\nIt’s called negativity bias, and it’s deeply wired. Psychologists have found we react to and remember negative experiences more strongly sometimes up to five times more than positive ones of equal intensity. Why? Because thousands of years ago, remembering what hurt was a matter of survival. You could forget a sunrise. But forget a snake in the grass? You’re gone.\n\nThis ancient programming worked great for staying alive in the wild but today it means we replay awkward moments, overthink failures, and lose sleep over things that aren’t actually dangerous.\n\nMindfulness doesn’t delete the bias, it helps us notice it. Instead of spiraling into the story, we can pause and name what’s happening, “That’s my brain holding onto a threat that isn’t real anymore.”\n\nImplications for practice:\n\n• Don’t judge yourself for ruminating — that’s old wiring.\n\n• Use breath and awareness to interrupt the loop.\n\n• Balance the scales by deliberately savoring small, good moments.\n\nYou don’t have to fight your mind. You just have to understand how it works, and meet it with kindness. “This too shall pass” applies to pain and also to peace. So hold both gently.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nThank you!",

The mind draws its strength from the being; when the being disidentifies from the mind, the energy that once empowered thought and emotion is withdrawn. Then, action—or inaction—becomes a conscious choice of the being.\n\nThis does not mean the being ceases to respond. That is not its nature. Rather, action comes from consciousness not from compulsiveness , and so does the mind.\n\nWhen the being becomes entangled in thoughts and perceptions, it loses touch with its intrinsic nature of oneness and equality. The true nature of the being is to transcend all boundaries, to go beyond the mind and body. \n\nthe path to greater awareness and fulfillment lies in going beyond these limitations. Through meditation and other inner practices, one can dissolve the identifications with mind and body, experiencing true freedom and a deeper connection to life.\n\n“Once you create a distance between you and your body, between you and your mind, that is the end of suffering” - Sadhguru",

But over time I noticed something deeper. My mind felt foggy. My thoughts were fragmented. Even when I wanted to be present, part of me was still somewhere else.\n\nIt was not just distraction. It was disconnection.\n\nThe turning point was when I started tracking how much time I was actually spending on my phone. And then, sharing it with someone else. There is something powerful about being seen. About saying out loud, this is how I am spending my life.\n\nNow I try to be more intentional. I study without my phone next to me. I work in silence. I check in with a friend about how I am using my attention. That tiny shift in awareness changed everything.\n\nIf you have been feeling distant from the present moment, maybe it is not your fault. Maybe your environment is louder than your intention.\n\nStart small. Change one thing. See what happens",

The term is a phenomenological construct to represent the felt experience of cognitive effort, and I'm signposting here as it's not supposed to be a mystical or 'esoteric' type of energy. However there is a tangible basis for a type of mental energy as brain metabolism does increase during sustained concentration, and the feeling of mental exhaustion after prolonged concentration, like exhaustion after physical exercise, further substantiates this.\n\nMy thesis though is that true free will is precisely this capacity to control the focus of one's attention; to volitionally direct or sustain that concentrated awareness. It's supported by a unified model of attention where a wide range of cognitive processes are interconnected in shared framework.\n\nThis axiom posits that the act of actively focusing is the irreducible *sine qua non* and prerequisite for exercising one's will, for making choices, and for navigating one's cognitive landscape with self-determination. It suggests that agency isn't merely a byproduct of thought, but is intrinsically linked to the active, effortful process of directing attention.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts and engage in discussion.",

    "text": "I let peoples crap talking control my life and I’m scared to face people that I know dislike me. I’m tired of it. So I noticed something about myself that I dislike quite a bit, and wanna change. Whenever I get word that a person is either speaking negatively about me, or thinks negatively about me, it literally consumes me in a way that isn’t healthy. I’ll begin to obsess over it, it’ll tank my mood, and overall, it’ll contribute to the negative image that I already have of myself. It also makes me afraid to face these people in person, almost as if I don’t deserve to be in their presence. The craziest part, is that most of the negativity towards me is unfounded, and I know that, yet in the moment, I just can’t get over it. \n\nI’ll give a recent example to show what this kind of looks like. At my previous job, my coworkers and immediate supervisor were just not good people. They would constantly put me down, disrespect me, violate my boundaries, exclude me, and lie to me and they would always justify it by saying that I need to stop taking things so personally because they “cared” about me and we were supposed to be a “family.” I tolerated this behavior for years and basically allowed myself to be a doormat until I eventually had enough. \n\nSince these guys kept holding the whole “family” thing over my head, I figured that I could talk to them like family. I tried to kindly express my concerns and the response I got was super adverse. They essentially all ganged up on me and collectively turned their backs on me. They started slandering me, gaslighting me into thinking that my feelings were unfounded, and that I was just being a “stereotypical woman” and acting in a way at work, that was clearly retaliation for what I had said. \n\nOnce that happened I felt that it was clear that these people disliked me, so when I got the news that I needed to leave the job (as I was moving away) I decided to leave and not say a thing to them. It’s been almost three years since this happened. We all still work in the same company, just at different locations. It’s a small world and as much as I’ve tried to move on with my life, I still hear on an almost daily basis that these guys are STILL talking an insane amount of crap about me. I’ve sent some of my employees to conferences that these guys were at, and my employees would come back and tell me that these guys were telling them horrible things about me. \n\nMy old supervisor is now in a much higher position in the company. Recently, he reached out to one of my employees to basically slander my work ethic and bitch about me over the phone. As soon as my coworker notified me of this, it ruined my whole day. I couldn’t stop thinking about it and it weighed be down for nearly a week. \n\nI am genuinely so sick of living like this. These people should not matter to me. Their opinions should not matter to me, especially since their negativity towards me is totally unjustified. How can I work past this? I know that as long as I stay with this company, the day will come when I get to stand face to face with these guys again. I wanna be able to look them in the eye with confidence instead of feeling ashamed and like I don’t deserve to be in their presence. I just wanna learn how to stop caring so much. Help?",

    "text": "I seem to only know “anticipation happiness” - does it exist in the present? I am not sure my title captures my question and I am not sure if I am even asking in the right place.   But I am really curious to hear the opinions of others who understand that the present is the only place to find “joy”.   I do understand that fact and I believe it.  I am also reasonably “good” and recognizing where my thoughts are but I seem to fail and using that knowledge to enjoy the present and not fixate on the future.  Put another way my understanding is intellectual but does not represent how I live my.  \n\nAs an example when I go on vacation with my family (to Japan where we go to see my wife’s family every year) I start the holiday full of anticipation and excitement for what might come.   And I generally have a good time with whatever happens in those first few days.   However it seems that always as the holiday passes halfway the anticipation is “gone” and replaced with a sad reality that “soon” our holiday will be over.  The silly thing is that we (I) may have 5 days left of a longer holiday and I recognize myself that I am wasting those days feeling bad about the fact that the end of the holiday is in sight even though there could be plenty of adventures left. \n\nMy apologies for this random stream of rambling but if I was to ask my question slightly differently,  I feel like the present moment (as important as it is) is less exciting than an anticipated future UNTIL that anticipated future is not as exciting.   My holiday example is only one version of how this plays out.  I also find that I overthink many things and I can create a future (catastrophize) that is imaginary, may not happen, and sometimes not even rational but it creates an anxious present reality for me that I can’t seem to move past. \n\nCurious how unique I am in this way of being and would love to hear of strategies / practices / that others uses to bring balance and or peace to your lives.",

I initially tried to post on the meditation subreddit but since I just joined I would have to wait so hopefully you guys can help too maybe :)\n\nHi guys, I am 20F and am interested in starting meditation practices. I have lived with anxiety my entire life. It has consumed my nervous system and my soul and has made day to day living almost unbearable. Especially since starting college, I notice that my anxiety is especially heightened surrounding social events, which is a huge part of college. I feel like I’ve lost all my social skills almost from succumbing to this anxiety in the past couple years especially and it’s extremely isolating. Nothing is exciting, I could be waiting to win a million dollars but still be shaking of anxiety beforehand and unable to stomach a meal. I also throw up way too much\n\nAnyways, I am a nervous wreck, and have never been able to be present in my life. I recently met this man who was 10 years older than me and seemed super tapped into his consciousness. He sort of sparked an interest within me for it, kind of had me thinking that I was supposed to meet this man so I could be introduced to all this stuff.\n\nI guess what I am asking is how do I get started? I bought the autobiography of a yogi book but honestly it was hard to read through. I tried using headspace but it’s so hard for me to actually go through even a 5 minute meditation. It’s so difficult for me and almost feels like a chore.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me?",

    "text": "Tea with a view! Does your environment change how you experience your tea? Let’s talk about our favorite tea-drinking spots. There’s a subtle but powerful relationship between place and perception—especially when it comes to tea. Drinking tea isn’t just about flavor or tradition; it’s about presence. And where we are, both physically and mentally, can deeply shape that presence.\n\nTake the balcony, for example. There’s something uniquely calming about steeping a pot of tea as the city hums softly below. You hear distant traffic, the flutter of pigeons, the murmur of the wind threading its way through high-rise corridors. A cup of tea in this setting doesn’t just warm your hands—it anchors you. The summer breeze brushes against your skin, carrying away stress like steam from the cup. Here, tea becomes a ritual of escape—a quiet defiance against the relentless pace of urban life.\n\nFor many of us, the balcony becomes a kind of threshold space. Not quite indoors, not quite outside. It’s elevated but still rooted in the city’s rhythm. In that liminal space, tea transforms. The same cup that might feel routine at a desk suddenly feels reflective, even meditative.\n\nSo yes—your environment matters. A shaded park bench, a sunlit kitchen, a breezy balcony, or even a windowsill with just enough room for a teacup. Each space adds its own notes to the brew—emotional, sensory, spatial.",

    "text": "90 days of daily reading changed how I feel, think, and talk - here’s how ; About three months ago, I hit a quiet kind of low. I’d just gone through a breakup, and with only 90 days left before turning 30, everything felt stuck. One night, I caught myself mindlessly scrolling for hours, feeling overstimulated and weirdly numb at the same time. My brain felt like mush, conversations felt robotic, and honestly, I barely felt like myself anymore. That night, I realized I needed to change - something small, something real.\n\nSo I went back to what used to ground me as a kid: reading. Just 20 mins before bed, no pressure. Within weeks, I was sleeping better, thinking more clearly, and surprisingly, feeling more confident talking to people. If you’ve been feeling foggy, disconnected, or stuck in phone loops, I hope this helps. Here’s what changed for me:\n\n- I became more articulate. Conversations now flow easier because I actually have thoughts worth sharing.\n- My overthinking calmed down. Reading slows your brain in the best way—like a deep breath for your mind.\n- I feel smarter. Not “trivia night” smart - more like mentally awake and aware of the world.\n- I socialize better. It’s easier to talk to people when your head isn’t full of static.\n- I replaced phone scrolling with reading before bed—and my sleep improved so much.\n- I got more creative. Reading fiction, especially, helped me feel connected to emotions again.\n- I started finishing things. Books, tasks, thoughts. I actually follow through now.\n\nSome resources that really helped me stay consistent and make this a lifestyle:\n\n- “Stolen Focus” by Johann Hari – NYT bestseller, by the author of “Lost Connections” – This book will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about attention. It exposed how modern tech rewires our brains and gave me practical, research-backed tools to reclaim my focus. Insanely eye-opening and weirdly emotional read. This is the best book I’ve ever read on how to take back your mind.\n\n- “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig – International bestseller with millions of copies sold – A soul-soothing novel that blends fiction and mental health. Made me cry (in a good way) and reminded me how powerful our small choices are. If you’re stuck in regret or decision paralysis, read this yesterday.\n\n- “Big Magic” by Elizabeth Gilbert – By the author of “Eat, Pray, Love” – This one cracked me open in the best way. It’s about living creatively, but not in a hustle way - more like how to live with less fear and more wonder. I reread this every year. Best book I’ve read on unblocking your creative energy.\n\n- website: BeFreed – A friend at Google put me on this. It’s an AI-powered book summary website that lets you customize how you read: 10-min skims, 40-min deep dives, or even fun storytelling versions of dense books (think Ulysses but digestible), and it remembers your favs, highlights, goals and recommend books that best fit your goal. Now, I finish 20+ books a month while commuting, working out, or even brushing my teeth. If you’ve ever looked at your TBR pile and felt overwhelmed, this is a game-changer.\n\n(btw. I still think fiction is best read in its original form - there’s no shortcut to great storytelling - but for most non-fiction (especially nowadays, when a lot of books stretch a 10-page idea into 300), BeFreed has been super helpful to me).\n\n - Ash – My go-to mental health check-in tool. Ash feels like texting a wise friend who actually gets it. It uses AI + cognitive behavioral prompts to help you reflect, regulate emotions, and process tough thoughts. Whenever I spiral or feel stuck, Ash helps me get grounded again. 10/10 recommend if therapy feels overwhelming or out of reach.\n\n- The Mel Robbins Podcast – If you're stuck in a rut, this one hits like a pep talk from your smartest friend. She breaks down mindset shifts, habit building, and self-sabotage in a super relatable, no-fluff way. Her episode on the “Let Them” theory lowkey changed my relationships.\n\n\nIf you’re feeling disconnected, anxious, or like your brain just can’t “keep up” anymore - I promise, it’s not just you. The world is overstimulating AF right now. But reading, even just a little each day, can help you build yourself back - smarter, softer, and more tuned in. \n\nYou don’t need to read 70 books a year. Just one chapter a day can start rewiring how you think, feel, and see the world.\nAnd if no one’s told you this lately: you’re not lazy or broken. You’re probably just overwhelmed. Try swapping 10 mins of scrolling for 10 pages of a book you actually like. That tiny habit changed my life. It might change yours too.",

He is suggesting that most people cannot still all emotions so they should try to hold onto positive emotions; Bhakti Marga helps in this.\n\n\"The sublimation of all emotions and mental activities of every kind is the direct practice of yoga.\"\n\nThe Lotus Consciousness\n\nYour consciousness is a lotus. The Egyptians used the symbols of the papyrus and the lotus, and the Indians, the Hindus, use the lotus.\n\nThe experience of Samadhi is a lotus blooming, but he goes to the source. - Osho\n\nJust as the lotus grows out of the muck of the pond without having to send down roots into the earth, so does nirvana grow from the muck of the mind. As shown in the below paragraph, Consciousness is behind the Mind.\n\nBrahman - Purusha/Prakriti - Consciousness (Crown/Lotus Chakra) - Mind (Third Eye) - Space (Throat Chakra) - Air (Heart Chakra) - Fire (Solar Plexus Chakra) - Water (Sacral) - Earth (Root) . - The Mahabharata.\n\nThe seventh chakra, also known as the crown chakra, is depicted as a thousand-petal lotus flower at the top of the head.\n\nThe third eye is a concept in Buddhism and Hinduism that represents a vantage point for achieving enlightenment and higher consciousness.\n\nMind is merely a reflection of Consciousness. When the reflection is destroyed, Consciousness shines through in all its glory through the jnani (wise person) when the mind is absent or still. - quotes taken from various articles.\n\nThe goal of meditation is to still the mind or empty the mind, and bring it to a zero-thought state or samadhi even for a split second. An empty mind is a full mind, for it contains all things but is never limited by them. When split-second samadhi occurs, in that moment there is no thought, but only an absolutely pure and heightened consciousness. Although this experience may be brief, it is timeless and infinite.\n\n\"When emotions are high, wisdom is low.\" “When emotions dominate, maturity and wisdom deteriorate.”\n\nWater does not stick to lotus leaves because of the leaf's hydrophobic, or water-repellent, surface. Emotions have a similar relationship, like water to lotus flowers, to an enlightened person or Jnani or wise-person.\n\nSamatva, or absolute freedom from emotions, has been set as one of the prime essentials for the health of the nerves and brain.” - Relax With Yoga, by Arthur Liebers, \\[1960\\].\n\n“He is completely freed from all emotions: Joy, envy, fear & anxiety cause inward agitations in men. Ever peaceful with himself & the world, the devotee is unaffected by these emotions, & deals with them with equanimity. Such a devotee is dear to Me.” - Bhagawat Gita.\n\n\"When karma is exhausted and emotions are emptied, that is a true Buddha.\" - quote from an article on Buddhism.\n\nBrain is the seat of mind. Mind is the seat of emotions.\n\n“Heart is the seat of consciousness.” Consciousness is the seat of peace/samadhi.\n\nIn samadhi, the mind returns to its original seat in the heart.",

    "text": "My quarter-life crisis has been going on for too long (3 years) - feeling lost and hopeless in life Hey all. This might not be the right subreddit for this but I'm looking for advice and some insight, thanks friends.\n\n  \nI'm a freelancer in the film world  as a director, and I live in London, I'm 29F and have always been an ENFP (campaigner) personality, so I'm very extroverted, I like to dream, I'm a go-getter. I always like keeping busy and trying new things, but recently it's becoming a problem. \n\n  \nI went on my first big backpacking trip 4 years ago, when I was heart set on being a big film director - I had no doubt I'd be super successful and thought it was what I wanted to do. Then I went solo travelling for 6 months and everything changed. My eyes were opened to the world and I was shown that the world is so big, and you can have any life you want. I experienced living by the ocean and fell in love with that feeling of being in a sunny place, being outdoors more, being near the ocean. \n\n  \nWhen I came back to London my world was turned upside down. I didn't know if I wanted to be a director anymore, I was tired of the stressful grind of being a freelancer and I felt like I had a quarter life crisis. I wasn't sure if I wanted to live in London anymore, I wanted to move and live by the sea. This is such a typical thing for people who have travelled for a long time, and I just felt like a stranger in my own mind. Everything felt uncertain, and I was struggling to find my path. \n\n  \nYears later, I still feel the same. I have been searching for my purpose in life, what career I want, what business I want to start, where I want to live, etc. I constantly flip-flop on ideas of what I want for myself, and I struggle to feel gratitude for where I am right now, living in my little studio flat in London. \n\n  \nOne thing I did learn was that I love my family and friends so much and it's important for me to be around them. I love British culture, it feels comfortable living here, but sometimes I get so fed up with the shitty weather and I fantasise about moving somewhere warmer, but I know I'd miss home so much. \n\n  \nI also don't have a normal 9-5, so money has been tight especially this year. Finding a job isn't that easy for me as I am a freelancer, and when I think of going full-time something in me says \"ugh don't work for someone, start your own thing\" - so I have started my own business after years of racking my brains of what kind of business to start (it's advertising/marketing in the travel space). \n\n  \nI broke up with my boyfriend of 2.5 years last night because I was struggling to see how our futures align. He has a normal 9-5, he's a sensible, logical and chilled person. I felt like I was leading the relationship, always the one to plan dates, book restaurants, think of where we can go camping together, and I felt like he was just there for the ride. He said he doesn't see moving in with me for a while because he owns a house with his brother and feels worried about my \"no sense of direction in life\" because it makes it hard for him to imagine a future with us together. I felt like our personality differences were becoming too much and I was feeling tired, so I ended it. \n\n  \nI know I need to go away and work on myself, figure out what I want and need from life. But I hate this feeling of uncertainty, of lack of purpose, of lack of direction. Who knows if moving countries will fix anything? I've done a lot of therapy in the past but I recently have found a new therapist to work on this with. My boyfriend said I struggle with gratitude \"you always want the next best thing, nothing is ever good enough for you\" and I agree. But am I asking for too much? I think he's fair enough to feel those things about me and to want someone more stable in life, but I think I deserve to find someone more on my wavelength.\n\nI'm so tired of feeling like a lost ghost, just dipping her toes into every random job and idea of the future, to see if it makes me feel a spark of life. I try to journal gratitude daily, but my friend said \"you need to feel grateful where you are right now, because that makes happiness\" but I struggle so hard. \n\n\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading, I appreciate this is a long winded story with a few themes but I would love some advice and insight into things.",

This denial leads to procrastination. \n\n\nNature gives us abundant resources but lack of empathy & love makes human to resort to unethical practices that make life difficult. \n\n\nPeople have a horrible sense of insecurity about themselves. The insecurity that someone may pull you down and exceed you. Their whole life is invested in looking a little better than others. \n\n\nThe drive to accumulate wealth can sometimes become an end itself, overshadowing the potential to use those resources for good, both for oneself and others. The fear of scarcity or desire for security can lead to hoarding even when abundance exists. \n\n‘The only way out is In ‘\nas rightly said by Sadhguru points to explore our inner abilities for expansion and growth curtailing the chattering of the mind and looking out for solutions.",

I am new to spirituality so appreciate any thoughts!\nOne of the most important things I want to transform in my life is dealing with stress and anxiety.\n\nFrom the book, Micheal Singer talks about how resistance to the flow of events causes stress. While I agree, but more importantly for me, ambiguity causes stress. I have some goals and ambitions in life, and I am not sure how to achieve them. I try different things, and I fail, which causes more disappointment and distress.\n\nI understand I shouldn’t resist the outcome.. but what should I really do? This state of not knowing causes more stress to me.\n\nIs having goals and ambitions not part of the spiritual lifestyle? Is planning for your future against the concept of living in the present ?",

    "text": "Whenever I'm not keeping busy I slide into rumination, hopelessness, and feeling lonely I'm writing this post mainly to clear out my own mind and put it all out there, but also to see if anyone has experience with this and knows how to sort it out. \n\nI'm a 25 year old woman who doesn't really have anything to complain about. I love my family to death. I am very attractive and have a lot of romantic prospects. I have a solid social life (though most of my friends bore me). I am about to start writing my master's thesis and in the meantime I've been freelancing. \n\nHowever, I constantly feel empty and unfulfilled. No matter how many guys approach me or how many exes still love me, I feel incredibly alone. No matter how many friends I go out with during the week or how much fun I have at certain events, it's never enough. No matter what milestone I reach, I don't feel a sense of pride or like I've really accomplished anything. \n\nThe euphoria fades, and I start feeling like nobody cares for me, like I'm a leaf on the wind, like I must have gone wrong somewhere in my life to be so unlovable or asocial or whatever negative trait my mind clings to at the moment. Instead of focusing on the things going well for me, I focus on the friend groups I don't have, on experiences I don't have access to, on group trips I never took, or feelings of joy and fulfillment that I'm not currently able to feel.\n\nIt's like I'm constantly chasing something intangible. Objectively I should be happy. But I'm not. I think I mask these feelings by scrolling reels or Tiktok or obsessing over my Instagram feed, and later hate myself for it, because that's only further eroding my happiness. I am severely addicted to my phone, and even when I put it down, my mind can't stop racing. \n\nThe only time these voices calm down is when I'm keeping busy, writing my thesis, working, or doing something productive. However, since it's quite difficult for my mind to get into deep focus, these moments of true serenity are quite rare and most of the time I'm exhausted from my own anxious and unhappy brain. \n\nWhy can't I just enjoy the calm in my free time? Is the only answer to just stay occupied and do meaningful work?",

    "text": "Does anyone feel the same? \nHi, I’m gonna start by saying that this post is mainly a rant. I know I should probably search help, but I reallly can’t, for reasons I’m gonna explain more in the post. \nSo, I’m a 17 year old girl, I live in Italy and I’ve lost my will to do everything. I don’t read anymore, I don’t text my friends as often, I don’t watch my tv series anymore (or anything at all), I don’t want to study anymore, I don’t wanna dance anymore, I just wanna lay in bed and disappear. It’s not like I don’t think people wouldn’t care if I disappeared, I know some would miss me, but they dont notice how much I’m struggling to keep this act together. \nAll my life I’ve been the good kid. I have always been the responsible one, the mature one, the straight A kid, the dedicated dancer, the perfect and respectful daughter. I was the kid that no one worried about. \nIn my friend group I have always been the weird one, the geek, the one that you go to when u haven’t done homework but the one that you don’t ask to hangout, because I’m boring and responsible and bla bla. Not all my friends think this way, but I know the majority of the do, and I’m starting to get tired of it. \nNo matter what I do or what I say, they never understand how I’m feeling right now. All they see is a thriving girl, with good grades, a good body, and a nice family. Truth is, I am not that girl, not anymore. \nI go to school 6 days a week, I work 3 nights a week, I go to dance practice 4/5 times a week, and I still get good grades, even when I don’t study. It’s like all that they see, the grades, my fake smiles. \nIn reality I have slowly started to loose communication with them, I don’t talk with my family much anymore (because they are always out), I struggle with my body image, something I have never had problems with, I hate going to dance, and work leaves me absolutely drained. \nPoint is, some of my friends have actually bigger problems, they have it worse, so I can’t complain to them because it would seem like I’m an ungrateful bitch who can’t see how privileged she is. \nI can’t talk with my family because If my mom knew that every morning I think about stepping into the traffic and go under a car she would send me straight to a therapist, and I really don’t have time to fit that into my schedule. \nPlus, I always have the feeling I’m overexagerating things, like maybe it’s all in my head and I’m just dramatic. \nBut then I remember I haven’t showered in 2 weeks, my rooms a mess, I cry every night and think that maybe I have the right to complain too. \nSo yesterday I was talking to a friend, and then we started talking about life and since I have been wanting to let this all out I started telling her all this, and no matter how tired I said I was her response was always something like “wow I could never do all those things” “wow, you really are something special” “wow, how do you do all that, I can’t even manage school alone” well, no shit Sherlock, I am struggling everyday just to get out of bed and not smash my head into the wall, so great of me really. \nWhy does no one get it I AM TIRED, I AM STRUGGLING, AND I WANT THIS TO STOP. I can’t even recognise my emotions apart from “tired” and “angry”. I don’t even feel hungry anymore, and my relationship with food and my body is starting to deteriorate. \nI feel like this all the time, but when in public my stupid ass puts on a happy facade and keeps making jokes about throwing myself under a bus or out the window, because I still can’t admit that I am doing too much and need to rest, because in my mind by resting I would be a disappointment and a failure. \nI was always the “fake it till you make it” but I had never gotten to the point where I couldn’t make it anymore. \nNow I’m here, confused, tired, and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to end my life, because it’s not too bad, and I scared that if I try and fail everything would be so much worse. \nWhat do I do to get out of this state? Is this really something serious or am I just exaggerating things and blowing it out of proportion? \nIf someone has been in a similar situation it would help to know, because right now it seems like there is a glass wall preventing everyone to really understand me, like I can’t reach them.\n\nThanks for reading, I am sorry if this kinda seems disorganised, but I couldn’t even keep my thoughts in a straight line, so I hope you got the message. I someone relates please tell me, because I’m starting to question everything. \n\nPs. I have read about emotional blunting, and even tho I relate to some of its aspects, I still have the doubt that I am faking this, that it’s all in my head and not real, since people don’t seem to notice.",

    "text": "How can I stop thinking about my bad past youthful years? This been an occurring problem I've had most of my adult life. A little about myself currently:\n\nI'm a 35 year old man. I'm married to a beautiful wife and have a year and a half old healthy toddler. I make a good salary in the Midwest, averaging about $110k per year in the past 5 years. I have a 3bdrm house and 3 cars shared between my wife and I. And we go on week long vacations at least once a year. I just typed all that because I have a good life, right? You're thinking, \"This guy has everything a man could ask for. Why is he stuck in the past?\" \n\nThese past seven years I admit has been the best years of my life, from late 20s to now. Before that, I lived a not so happy life. And I admit I always lived in self pity. I admit that. I grew up with a single mom of three. My dad died when I was five, so I had very little male guidance. I lived in a rough environment that was filled with drugs, gangs, and violence. Pre-adolescence, I was a skinny, quiet nerdy looking boy who wore glasses (this was in the 90s when glasses wasn't cool). I didn't go outside that much out of fear of being teased, bullied, or being a victim of violence. Not only that, but I didn't have much in common with the boys in the neighborhood who always played rough, since i was shy and quiet. In high school, I diagnosed myself with depression. I never had a girlfriend in high school. I was called ugly a lot, so of course that killed my self esteem. I mean sheesh, the savagery was harsh at the time. I commuted by public transportation to school everyday by myself through rough neighborhoods. At 16, I randomly got jumped on at the bus stop by a group of 10 to 15 boys. That was actually the second time I got jumped in my life. The first time happened when I was 12 by four boys at a playground I was trying to make friends with. Watching the news in my teenage years used to scare me. The things I saw on the news is what I saw in person at the time. My depression affected my grades and I eventually graduated with a low GPA. I didn't experience prom or senior luncheon or other parties because, you know, self pity, low self esteem, being too introverted, etc. I remembered I used to try to vent to my mom about my unhappiness. She thought I was a softy and never tried to console me. In hindsight, maybe I was a softy.\n\nI tried the college thing and after 3 years, I couldn't finish. I studied engineering, which was tough. But more importantly, I had no friends there when I left. I originally had friends my freshman year but they dropped out after a year. My social life took a tumble shortly after. The student body in college were mostly foreign students who only mingled with their own kind, so I really didn't fit in anywhere. They were nice. We just weren't close. And sometimes they would give me a one word answer with a smile. So yeah, I couldn't finish college. \n\nAfter college, I was working odd jobs while living in my aunt's basement. I bought my first car (a 19 year old two door hooptie) at 24. I then entered the trades as an Apprentice. I admit that the trades was slowly changing my life, even though my first few years was rough.  As an apprentice, you get treated like crap. The yelling, the name calling, the heavy work load, It was literally a hostile environment but it was nothing I wasn't used to so I stuck it through. In spite all that, I had my first girlfriend at 25! We only lasted a couple of months though. I've dated a few other women after that over the years until I met my now current wife at 28. And after experiencing so many layoffs and unemployment in the construction industry since 24, I've finally worked a stable job I had since the age of 30 making six figures per year.\n\nSorry about the long rant. I was just going down memory lane as I was typing. My life has been very good since my late 20s. But every once in a while, if I look at a young cute couple walking down the street, or I see a teenage boy on social media showing off his new car, or I see a group of young friends hanging out together, I experience a feeling of sadness, or maybe even jealousy, which is weird. Like, this is prom season now, and I've felt this mild depression recently that came out of nowhere. How the heck do I get over that? It's not something that happens everyday. It happens about once a month. But when I do experience it, the sadness and maybe jealousy is intense.",

    "text": "Hope other ladies can relate to this... I’ve been practicing mindfulness, meditation, and Qigong for years. These practices have been life-changing in helping me stay grounded, reduce my PSM/period symptoms, regulate emotions, and live with more awareness, especially as a sensitive person. But I've been alone on this path from the very beginning, and I've grown tired of not having any soulful connections in real life... and hiding all this, to be honest..  \n  \nThat’s why I’m exploring the idea of starting a women’s circle/community. A space where we can show up together as we are and be supported in living more mindfully, practice Qigong, meditation, learn to stay grounded and show up authentically. A place to share practices, stories, and maybe sit together in silence from time to time. I’m also a certified medical Qigong instructor for women, so I’d love to host weekly Qigong classes within the community focused on nervous system support, emotional balance, menstrual wellbeing, etc. I also have other ideas to enrich this.\n\nIt’s not anything polished or finalized at this point, just something I’ve been craving and want to create with others. I’d love to hear if this resonates with any ladies here. Have you also felt this way? Would you want to join something like this?",

And slowly, it started making sense.This is what spiritual integration actually means. so often, our mind wants one thing, our soul knows another…..and they’re in constant friction.The mind’s always chasing. More success. More validation. More “what next.”While the soul? It just wants stillness. Clarity. Truth.This line made me realize that true peace isn’t about fixing everything outside. It’s when your mind no longer fights your soul.When thoughts stop running ahead, and you finally sit in your own presence.When you no longer chase or resist, and instead, understand who you really are beneath everything. It made me think..maybe the journey is not about adding more, but peeling back what was never truly us.",

The trouble begins when we mistakenly believe we’re in charge of these experiences, that we are the authors of what arises in the mind. This illusion of control creates unnecessary struggle.\n\nThe reality is, once a moment has passed, it’s gone. Yet our 'confused mind' keeps trying to grasp or fix what no longer exists. That’s where a lot of our inner struggle comes from.\n\nThe practice, then, is to notice this habit—to catch those moments when your mind clings to something that no longer exists (This is what it means to be thinking).

I am a huge over-thinker and unfortunately for me most of those thoughts tend to be negative toward myself, usually I can keep them in check but when I’m going through a rough patch in life like the past few days it gets bad, I felt suicidal today, the thoughts would get so bad I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed and hopeless. Despite me trying out affirmations (for years) that would work for a few seconds maybe a few minutes, but I always knew the negative voice would come back. \n\nThe solution: Intense affirmation based journaling\n\nI’ve journaled before but not like this. \n\n If your brain is going crazy and you can’t control the thoughts, just sit at a computer or even phone, and type a postive story about yourself along with words of affirmations  use “I am happy, I am confident..” what ever you feel you are lacking, but also maybe insert a story in there or ramble positively and keep inserting affirmations in there, so your brain doesn’t get bored with just “I am..” statements. \n\nThis worked for me because your brain has no choice to listen to what you type out, it can’t deviate from what you put infront of it and read in your head, it’s too busy focusing on the words you write. \n\nSo essentially flood your own brain / reprogram with repeated positive words / the story you tell yourself. \n\nIt’s easy to do, and it gives your brain no way out, the good thing about it is that, when you stop writing, the momentum keeps on, if it wains just keep writing, and force your brain to read it as you write and believe the words. \n\nIt sounds simple and maybe silly, but sit down and do it for a few minutes the longer the better, the more blocked out time your brain has in positive thinking. \n\nReally hope this helps at least 1 of you as it’s helped me.",

    "text": "Sure, or to see one’s self-image as an illusion, whether negative or positive. It’s a fictional paradigm where we see ourselves as action figures. \n\nOnce you “wake up” to that realization about the world the bondage of self-image (supposedly) falls away. You no longer are “the kind of person who wears a Rolex” or a Uni-grad or devout practitioner of your religion, or a loser that nobody likes. \n\nThere have been many people who advocate the medication method: combat one’s internal negative self-image with a positive attitude. “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and by golly, people like me!”  \n\nObviously works for many but I never found much comfort in reviewing my own resume to perk my self-image up. Super-accomplished folks often have severe self-doubts. Anyway, just a rando on the internet musing. 😀",

The one that stayed with me and i'm still practicing 25+ years on is daoist nei gong.\n\nIts an internal body based practice, that connects out into the mental/emotional/energetic sides. One idea its based on is that all of those levels are interconnected. Also that its most easy to work on the body first, as its the most tangible/accessible.\n\nThen layered into this is a practice of scanning the body and releasing tensions. As we release these, we release the stored traumas/negative 'personality traits' that are tied to them. Also as we learn to release more at the physical level, this 'quality of release' spreads through the system and it becomes easier to more directly release emotions/mental patterns/negative energy.\n\nAt the same time qi/positive energy is built in the system. This helps to flush out the negatives, and more importantly has its own intrinsic positive value, and helps return us to a happier, healthier state.\n\nIf you want to know more, there are resources here that you can investigate and/or get started from - \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei\\_gong\\_from\\_a\\_more\\_mentalemotional\\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei_gong_from_a_more_mentalemotional_healing/)",

You are using your own thoughts to hurt yourself, and it seems here you have recognized that the thoughts aren’t even rational to begin with. \n\nWhen I get into a funk like this, I will treat my thoughts the same way I treat Alexa™️ when she is stuck on a bad playlist. “Alexa, next. Alexa, next.” Except for now it’s “Mind, next. Mind, next.”\n\nIt’s important to shake those thoughts out most of the time. Just get them *out* of there ya know? The more you let these thoughts dwell, the more your brain will build and reinforce a neuronal superhighway that takes you straight into depression town. It simply responds to demand. If, based on your thoughts, it seems you want an easy-access way to put yourself down, the brain will give you that. \n\nInstead we can try forcing better thoughts, as fake as they may be. The brain doesn’t care, it will start building that neural pathway anyway. Eventually these better thoughts start to ring true, while the old “depression highway” in your head starts to decay from abandonment. Soon there’s only one neuronal path left: the one of good thoughts you’ve worked hard to build. \n\nWhatever thoughts you want to have more of, start out by thinking em by force if you have to. Meditate on the goodness you see in yourself — just hold the thought that you are good, etc. in your otherwise-quiet mind. Be so, so nice to yourself. Choose yourself first,  be your own best friend, pump yourself up…. Fake it til your brain makes it. \n\nAnd by the way, it is a *good* thing that you are able to recognize that one of your thoughts isn’t being fair to you, or anyone else for that matter. That means they don’t resonate with you, you don’t believe them, and you want ‘em gone anyway. That makes the whole thing a lot easier.",

Doing this in 2024 with my mother was the ultimate in acceptance and surrender. Since then I’ve done some MDMA therapy which has been amazing for trauma.",

There was a natural thought about \"if only I'd started earlier\" - but that would mean a different life path.  I have children and wishing them away or different is inconceivable, so the path I took was perfect.\n\nThe journey could not have been easier even if I'd been someone else at the start.  But that is absurd.  Our paths are hard because no matter where we begin, we still must grow.  Seeking an easier path is a waste of time.

    "text": "\"Into the Wild\" is a good cautionary tale, but I wouldn't take that as an accurate representation of life in the wild. Basically, it's the tale of a woefully unprepared idiot Christopher McCandless, who ignored all the many, many warnings he was given, ignored all the survival advice many people gave him, apparently ate toxic wild plants he didn't recognize as toxic (forensic conclusion), and died as a result. He thought he already knew everything he needed to; he was dead wrong (Oo! A pun!).\n\nA much better one is \"Alone in the Wilderness\", home movie documentary of Richard Proenneke, who in 1968 moved to the Alaskan wilderness, hand-built his own log cabin solo, with hand tools, and lived there successfully for 30 years.\n\nUnlike McCandless, Proenneke actually knew what he was doing. He spent much of his life outdoors. Worked on a farm, was in the Navy, worked a sheep ranch, and was a highly skilled and sought-after diesel mechanic and carpenter, and was salmon fisherman up in Alaska, too.\n\nI live on the edge of the wilderness myself, up in the Cascade Mountains of Washington state, right on the edge between civilization and wilderness. Surrounded by forested mountains on all sides, but still a paved road to my home and grid electrcity and broadband internet. Nearest fast food place and supermarket is 25 miles away. \n\nI'm much happier living here than I ever was living in any city or town. I did a lot of backpacking in my youth, had a shelf of books on edible and useful wild plants and wilderness survival skills. So living out here is pretty easy for me. \n\nJust as cities have a whole bunch of rules for living; everything from \"look both ways before crossing the street\" and \"you need money for food and rent, and therefore some kind of income to pay for it all\", the wilderness has it's own set of rules which city people tend to know nothing about. Far less complicated than city rules, but you do need to observe a few basic precautions, just as you do with handling things like electricity, propane, cars, kitchen knives.\n\nFor most, the wilderness is a frightening, mysterious place 'Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!\". To me, it's just home--and I feel much safer out here than I ever did in the city. \n\nFor me, yes, nature *does* feel far more natural a way to be than civilization. So many human predators, criminals, cops, and predatory co-workers including bosses, a ton of rules and laws...it's incredibly regimented.\n\nOut here...life is a lot more slow-paced. I do things by the calendar, not by the clock. I get things done on my own schedule, not some predatory exploitive boss's, and at my own pace. I can relax out here, and feel like myself, my true inner self, in a way I never could in any city where I had to constantly conform to people's expectations, and all the peer pressure, and being bombarded with intrusive ads everywhere, with little more to say than \"we want your money\". Cities and suburbs are so extremely corporate...and I didn't realize just HOW dominant corporate rule was, until I moved away from all that.\n\nSo much easier to just live in the moment, out here. It's quiet. It's peaceful. It's gorgeous in all directions. I'm retired, so my time is my own. I'm never required to be at any particular place at any particular time. And since I'm retired, I can't be fired. Took many years to make my present life possible.\n\nOut here, it's nature's rhythms, and my own, that dominate. It's very mesmerizing, just sitting next to one of my windows, watching the rain or the snow fall. Watching the clouds move, alternately hiding and revealing the mountains around me. Meditate all I want.\n\nI will never ever willingly move back to city or small town living ever again. I was miserable every second of city living.\n\nI'd be deeper in the wilderness still, if I legally could, without giving up my broadband internet. Heh. But even out here, government tends to be rather intrusive, authoritarian, and predatory--but far less so than in a city or suburb.\n\nWhat Proenneke did in the 1960s isn't legal today. Many people have the fantasy of moving to the wilderness, Grizzly Addams style (I did in my childhood and teen years), but the days of the Homestead Act are long gone. Everywhere is owned by someone, and there's lots of laws and codes restricting what you can do--many are hostile to low-income people.",

Used to get lonely a lot, as a kid, but slowly grew used to it, then grew to prefer it.\n\nAlso, I am severely hearing impaired, so trying to converse with people offline is..more a frustrating waste of time than anything else as I can't understand them and they won't write down what they're saying. I had enough of that.\n\nIf I want conversation, I come here. There's thousands of conversations going on constantly, about all kinds of things. Here, my hearing isn't a problem, and I don't have to struggle trying to understand what people are saying. \n\nMost of my replies on here are usually me answering questions like yours, or me helping people with things. It is a strange experience, as more and more, people are praising the quality of my writing, and complimenting me on wisdom. \n\nI enjoy it, and I find it is enough to prevent loneliness for me. I see all the jokes and teasing and playfulness, and I see people helping each other, too. Very heartwarming for me.\n\nI also keep a daily journal where I talk to myself in writing. Been doing that every day for decades now, much like Henry David Thoreau's diary which became his book \"Walden\"...been refining my writing for many years this way, and it is also really good therapy for me.\n\nI keep my mind and my hands busy. I have many hobbies, read and study new things every day. I'm a lifelong learner and that is among my most rewarding hobbies. I do art, and create music, and write hours daily at what is apparently lightning speed, and teaching myself to make animated movies right now; that's my newest adventure.\n\nI love the effect studying computer animation and film making has on my mind and my mood. \n\nI suspect I'll likely eventually gather an online team of fellow dreamers eventually to make movies together, much like Jim Henson gathered his team of puppeteers. \n\nFor me that's not about money. It's more about...disguising wisdom in the form of entertaining movies, that maybe might help the world be a little bit better, for millions of people. \n\nThe same wisdom that got me out of a very, very dark place, might also maybe help the whole world get out of the current global darkness I'm seeing.\n\nMake movies along the lines of \"The Boy, The Mole, The Fox, and The Horse\"...(a wonderful, gentle, compassionate, wise animated movie).\n\nLikely nothing will come of it. But one never knows. I'm retired, and at the very least, this is wonderful therapy.",

In reality, Homo Sapiens has its own roots into technology, it is a way to express our way of being human, exactly akin to how an animal hunts and a plant searches for the sunlight. It is not to be seen as evil, or unnatural.\n\nEscaping the daily routine and appreciating nature is incredible and refreshing. I feel incredible when I do. But I also get to appreciate how incredible cities are. Offices. Cars. Internet. Hospitals.\n\nCities, technology and modernity aren't evil.

    "text": "In the context of mindfulness, sitting with a thought/emotion basically means to just let it happen, stopping yourself from actively following along with it (some following along will happen by itself, especially in the beginning, and that's totally fine), don't try to analyze it, don't judge it, don't try to change it. All you have to do is stay in the present moment and be aware of what's passing through your head.\n\nTrying to understand the emotions or what they mean is just about the last thing this is about, so I guess in that sense you're lucky. You can't force this kind of resolution, it will happen on its own if you create the right conditions, and sitting with it tends to do that.\n\nIt sounds crazy if you've never experienced what this process does, but it really works. Think of it like this (though that's not what happens physically, of course): any emotions that you struggle with are \"build-up\" and the way to resolve that is to let them happen. Both amping them up (by wallowing in them) and trying to stop/remove them or \"argue them out of existence\" interferes with this natural resolution, which is why lots of feelings never go away: basically everyone does one of these.\n\nTo be fair, this can be challenging to do with very strong feelings, because you're very used to judging them – you want them gone, after all – and they tend to absorb a lot of attention so it's easy to get lost in them and lose track of the present moment. So, if you want a more gentle introduction, do it with something less intense first, something you don't feel too strongly about, just to see what happens. If you do try with strong feelings, don't put yourself down if you can't quite manage it. Doing the best you can at that point in time, without \"trying hard\", is all you need to do. It's also perfectly normal for some big thing to not just resolve itself in two minutes (though that can happen too!). Just keep at it and let time do its job.\n\nI've gotten into a mindset where I think of these feelings and thoughts as echoes of the past that I've never given time to work themselves out, that makes it easier for me to not judge, and also to be okay with times when they still keep going even though I'm doing everything right.\n\nI hope this helps, but I'm happy to explain more (from my perspective and level of experience, that is). Feel free to ask whatever you like!",

    "text": "I think “sitting” with your emotions is a more passive action than what you’re describing. You can reflect on what the root cause might be, but you don’t necessarily have to attempt to “remove” the thoughts about what got you there. Sitting with your emotions is acknowledging them, feeling them, learning about them, trying to understand them, but also learning to flow ~with~ them instead of fighting against them. Sometimes we’re so desperate to escape intense feelings that we take steps/ action to make them go away (think drinking, partying, picking fights, self harm, physical activity, or any other distraction), but in fact that really just puts a lid on the bottle and forces you to save it for later. \n\nAKA: If you’re sad, stop resisting and just let yourself be sad. Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel deeply and actively allow yourself to do so. See where that takes you and what thoughts come up. If you’re angry, allow yourself to be angry, just try to keep any outwardly destructive action contained.",

    "text": "* I take the most literal version of sitting with your thoughts and emotions to be having a seat and doing nothing but being with your experience of having these thoughts and feelings. \n\n* Nothing lasts, including thoughts and feelings. Everything changes. So even if you do nothing else, as long as you don't feed into them, then they will eventually dissipate. \n\n* If you want to and can take it a step further, you learn to view your thoughts and feelings as something you are experiencing like any other sensation in your body rather than who or what you are. \n\n* You can be aware of the sensation of anger or sadness in your body the same way you can be aware of the sensations of a headache or being wet or feeling the sun on your face.\n\n* And just like with a headache, you don't always have to figure out why you feel what you feel emotionally or fight with your thoughts. You can just let them be and be aware of experiencing them. \n\n* You can do it for as little or as much time as you find helpful or you can tolerate it. You can start with a minute and work your way up. You may find the longer you can sit with it the more benefit you experience.\n\n* There is even a version of these things where you find comfort in the experience because of how you relate to it, the same way we find comfort in other kinds of otherwise uncomfortable experiences because you know it will pass and you know that you will gain something valuable from it.\n\n* My own experience is that trying to analyze and dismantle my uncomfortable feelings can often do me more harm than good because I learned to ruminate and feed into them. And sometimes it just becomes cyclical instead of actually accomplishing anything. But if I just let them be, as hard as it is sometimes, I know they will heal and dissipate.\n\n* I may be on the spectrum also, these things are what I have learned and practiced and observed in my own lived experience. I hope you might find something that helps you in them.\n\n* I wish you the best of luck!",

    "text": "HOW TO WITNESS - THE POWER OF NOW\n\n„If thine eye be single, thy whole body will be full of light“ - Jesus.\n\nWitnessing works with the 3rd eye, which is the master switch, which fills every chakra/dimension with light.\n\nIt is the Christ Mind or Buddha eye. It is 3 dimensions higher than the mind and 2 dimensions higher than the heart, hence it is love at the highest level.\n\nYou do not need to focus on individual chakras. The Witness/3rd eye is the Christ Mind. It knows what is needed. It is the highest wisdom and love. You do not need to direct attention to individual chakras.\n\nJust focus on transmuting low vibrations, the negative or false into their highest potential. To transmute thoughts into their highest potential, ie stillness, bliss, love, you need to observe thoughts.\n\nIn the same way you watch tv, from a distance, ie you are here, the tv is there, watch your thoughts from a distance. When you watch tv you do not try to control the action, you allow it to unfold, you do not interfere or get entangled. In the same way, allow your thoughts to come and go, do not try to control them, just watch with detachment, without labeling them, without classifying/judging them.\n\nJust watching with detachment. You are in the 6th chakra, the 3rd eye, the mind is in the 3rd chakra, the solar plexus, hence there is distance between you and the mind. However, you do NOT focus on the 3rd eye, you focus on thoughts. It is too powerful to focus on the 3rd eye and could lead to mental problems. To transmute emotions, you need to fully feel your emotions, feel your anger, feel/scan the pain body, the energy of the inner body, feel the tension, feel the organs.\n\nWhen suffering is conscious it ends. It seems like a good strategy to try to avoid painful emotions, but that represses them and they grow in the dark and become your sickness, and they they start to influence your behaviour/character. A little effort is needed in the beginning in order to connect with the inner current.  Once this is established it starts to do the work, pulling you inwards and upwards, thus leaving you free to get on with life.\n\nIt can be going on in the background and does not separate you from life. You can witness while working, walking, talking, reading.\n\nIt does not need special conditions, eg a quiet place or a special posture. It can be done anywhere at any time, ie all day every day.  It is the most natural and practical form of meditation, and you start at the top, which is a very high vibration. In the beginning it is hard to hold such a high vibration.\n\nWe may only be able to witness off and on throughout the day for a few minutes at a time, but soon it will become established and natural and very enjoyable, rather than an effort. As we begin to shed the pain body, deeply buried repressions will start to come to the surface for release and healing. Do not be dismayed.\n\nThis is deep healing of an ancient chaos.  For lifetimes you have repressed emotions/thoughts, not knowing how to transmute them. Most people only have 2 options: express/repress.  But with witnessing, we have a 3rd option, ie witness/transmute. If the mind is too busy or stressed, the breathing will be fast, shallow, hard.\n\nIf you consciously breathe slowly, deeply, gently, this will stop thoughts, making it easier to access a meditative position. A few minutes of conscious breathing, where you feel the air going in and out, ie breathe mindfully, is a good preparation for your usual meditation.\n\nMindfulness is the most natural and practical meditation. It does not require special conditions/postures. A little effort is needed in the beginning to reach the inner current.\n\nOnce you are connected, it will do the work, pulling you inwards and upwards, effortlessly, leaving you free to get on with life. It can be done while working, studying, talking, watching tv, walking etc. It is possible to live totally above the mind (thought/emotion) all day every day and fully function.\n\nTo start with you could meditate morning and evening and maybe off and on during the day, whenever you have a spare moment, eg when making tea or walking around the office/home. Even a few minutes here and there will give permanent gain.\n\nPerseverance, patience, endurance, willpower will surely bring success and build spiritual stamina - these qualities will grow.  Meditation strengthens the real and the beautiful. It is identification with the real/Soul. It is oneness with God, oneness with the Soul.   Even a few minutes is very valuable - it will be a permanent gain.  In the beginning it is hard to stay awake.\n\nHard to hold such a high vibration - the Witness Position is 3 dimensions higher than the mind, 2 dimensions higher than the heart - but even small amounts regularly will build momentum and enable you to stay longer and longer in the Witness Position.\n\nMeditation puts you above the mind, above the will, above the doer, above the laws of karma, above the facts.  It is a complete discipline in itself and can take you to enlightenment.“",

Even a few minutes here and there will give permanent gain - drip drip drip - moments of consciousness accumulate and gather momentum. No beginner enjoys meditation.\n\nThe mind has incredible momentum and will rebel.  Yogananda said it takes 3 years to attain concentration.  I never thought I could persevere.  My concentration seemed poor, as I had had a breakdown.  The only thing that kept me going was that I have an ivy plant that had never grown nor lost a leaf in 4 years.  When I started meditating in front of it, every day there were several new leaves and each week it had grown about a foot.\n\nThis proved that the energies being generated were powerful - even though I never noticed any benefits for 2 years, despite meditating all day every day.  I started with chanting a mantra, then discovered mindfulness.  All my students got immediate benefits with this form. For countless lives you have been repressing emotions, not knowing how to transmute them.  It is a very ancient chaos.\n\nAs you begin to shed the pain body, deeply buried repressions start to come to the surface for release/healing.  Whatever goes down must come up.  Thousands of lives of suffering cannot be undone in a matter of months.  It may take years, decades or lifetimes, depending how much time you devote to witnessing. Perseverance, patience, endurance, willpower will surely grow and bring success and build spiritual stamina - meditation strengthens the real and the beautiful. It is identification with the real/Soul.\n\nIt is oneness with God, oneness with the Soul.   Even a few minutes or seconds is very valuable - it will be a permanent gain.  Drip, drip, drip - these small moments accumulate.  In the beginning it is hard to stay awake.  Hard to hold such a high vibration - the Witness Position is 3 dimensions higher than the mind, 2 dimensions higher than the heart - but even small amounts regularly will build momentum and enable you to stay longer and longer in the Witness Position.\n\nMeditation puts you above the mind, above the will/doer, above the laws of karma, above the chooser, above the facts.  It is a complete discipline in itself and can take you to enlightenment. If the mind is too noisy, try a few minutes of conscious breathing - slow, deep, gentle breaths - feel the air enter and exit.  This will stop thought and make it easier to detach from the mind and enter a meditative position. This is all you need to understand.  The long explanations are just for the purpose of appreciation.\n\nBreathe deeply, gently, slowly for a few minutes.  This should stop thought and help you detach from the mind.  When you are detached from the mind, it is easier to access wp (the Witness Position) and watch your thoughts.  Just watch them, do NOT try to control them, do not try to stop them or judge/label them.  Just ALLOW them to come and go without getting involved.  Be the Watcher, not the thinker.\n\nHow can mindfulness improve your attention and health? Meditation strengthens the real and totally ends the false. It goes to the root of all suffering. Hence, it will strengthen willpower, perseverance, endurance, patience. The mind is unconscious/asleep. When we are in a meditative position, eg the Witness Position in mindfulness, we are 3 dimensions above the mind and the lower laws of karma, above the doer/will/chooser/facts.\n\nEvery time we meditate, we are awake. The more we practice, the easier it is to stay awake. The mind/sleep has incredible momentum and it will be difficult to stay awake in the beginning, in the Witness Position. The Witness Position is a very high vibration - 6th chakra/dimension/single eye. The mind is the 3rd. Even a few minutes off and on during the day - drip drip drip - is a permanent gain and very valuable.\n\nYogananda said it takes 3 years to acquire concentration, because the mind is very rebellious and sleep is heavy. However I attained concentration in a much quicker time, but I meditated all day every day, even while working, talking, reading, walking etc.\n\nMy students also were quickly able to stay awake and even totally free of thought for long periods after a few months.“\n\n~ Joya",

It might help you get in touch with your feelings a bit more to understand them.\n\nyes, sometimes it makes sense to fix the thing (a broken doorknob that I can fix should be fixed so I can use the door normally)\n\nWhen it comes to thought and emotion, it doesn't work the same way.  Sometimes we need to feel the experience to process the emotion and let it run its course.  Sometimes suppressing it won't work and it will just bubble back up somewhere else or in a different form (I started meditating because my hands were going numb from stress)\n\nif you can learn to watch your thoughts without interacting them, you might notice that sometimes they break up and disappear on their own.\n\n\nA helpful visualization for me is the idea of dropping something rather than pushing it away.  Pushing it away will create resistance and takes effort.  Dropping something is just not holding it any more and takes less effort than holding it.  I hope that makes sense.",

    "text": "To me sitting with emotion or thought is easier if my life is quiet. Try turning it all down... and start cultivating silence and stillness into your life. Avoid the bombastic, loud, emotional, dramatic world (social media, movies, news, content). (example: turn off the music when you drive. or when you get home don't automatically turn on the tv).   \n  \nWhen you get comfortable with longer periods of silence, let the mental, calm space in the mind detect (become aware of) self-defeating thoughts and emotions as they arise or shortly after they surface. Just **notice** them. ( How is it expressing in the your body? What kind of mental pictures come along? Do you think it could be time to drop it? Is there a different perspective I'm not aware of? )   \n  \nDon't reject, project, or suppress. This seems very scary at first... but be brave and trust.  This is the 'sit with it' part.... don't push it away... but be brave, strong enough to hold it and extract the lesson. Maybe bring in some softness to the thought or memory. They are only movements of energy that are actually trying to tell you something. Realize that thoughts and emotions are perceived by our Awareness which is the field in which thoughts and emotions arise (the noticing).  \n  \nThese are just first steps... but remember... the ego/ the world/ thought/ emotion are not as powerful as they present. You seem to recognize it already. But be wise not to fight it, just 'use' it (by sitting with it) to see yourself more clearly, and maybe break through to a new/higher energy field.",

    "text": "\"Sitting with a thought/emotion\" means letting it exist without trying to push it away, fix it, or analyze it. Instead of looking for the cause or a solution, it’s about noticing the feeling, acknowledging it, and allowing yourself to experience it without reacting.\n\nA simple way to practice this is to describe what you're feeling in the moment: *\"Right now, I feel anxious. My chest is tight. My thoughts are racing.\"* Then, instead of trying to make it stop, you just breathe through it. Imagine you’re watching a storm through a window rather than being caught in it.\n\nIf it helps, you can set a timer—maybe 2 or 5 minutes—where you give yourself permission to just *feel* without judgment. You don’t have to like it, but you don’t have to run from it either. Over time, it gets easier to tolerate, and the feelings often pass on their own.",

Imagine someone busting their ass off all their life and dreaming of living easy and boring 9 continuous years. I think the question is less in the facts than in what you feel about them. Take whatever state of mind you're in and contemplating it for a while : \"I feel very uncomfortable doing nothing right now. I feel the discomfort tickling in my arms and stomach, I feel a whirlpool in my brain, I want to stand up and run (...whatever is true for you).\" Accept it as is. You feel tickles, you want to run, all of that is fine. Let go of any desire to change what you describe. Accept everything exactly as it is. You can think \"I feel it tickling in my arms and I accept it.\" Verbalising the acceptance helps to make it true. \n\nYou can take a few intentional moments somewhen in your day to do this, some time that suits you. Don't make it long at first. Sports people usually say that regularity matters more than intensity, I think it applies to mindfulness as well. If you create the pathways in your brain that you want, it will be easier to widen them over time, rather than to dig huge highway sections every once it a while\n\nWishing you enjoyment on the way!",

    "text": "Software developer here - if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.\n\nI'm detecting that this is important for you. You're clearly thinking about it, and have taken steps to start the path. However, I'd like to probe your thinking a bit if you don't mind.\n\nWhy CS, and why a programmer? Is the desire to go into CS and work in the field because at the current moment you feel that it is the type of work that you really enjoy, will bring you a certain level of satisfaction, or be financially rewarding? Could it be that this was something you were interested in, tried, did not \"succeed\" to your satisfaction, and therefore it has stuck with you - tied to some feelings of inadequacy?\n\nI have such a feeling towards Japanese - I was quite good as a teen, lived there for half a year, then stopped learning when I got back. Feelings come up of \"I should really master it\", but  the important question is \"why\". Am I doing it to prove that I could (buff the ego), am I doing it because it would be useful to my life right now, am I doing it because it's the thing I love above all else? The answer for me is \"no, I like it, and that could have been nice to stick with, but there's reasons it didn't happen, and if I let it go, I can focus more on what makes me happy now\".\n\nNow, once you have sat with those feelings a bit, you should have a better idea about the reasoning. Watch that reasoning, and see if there are any other opportunities to satisfy that same reasoning. Maybe there's something else you could be doing that can get you where you want to be in a better way, not necessarily tied to your history with CS specifically. Or, maybe CS fits all of the criteria of what you need. Either way, this type of introspection, and non-judgemental questioning, should help you get to your answer.",

    "text": "Hi! Great question. The presence of thoughts has no bearing on the success of meditation. It is ultimately possible to develop the ability to snuff out thoughts as they arise, but that will probably come after a significant amount of practice. \n\nFor now, don’t be concerned with whether or not there are thoughts. Meditation has much more to do with our relationship with our attention and awareness. If you know you are meditating, you are meditating. Initially we are really only trying to develop the ability to resist our thoughts capturing our attention to the point where we forget that we are meditating. But this is likely to still happen for some time - and that’s fine. The early stages of meditation is likely to involve a lot of mind-wandering. Then, at some point, you will remember that you are supposed to be meditating. When this happens, take a brief moment to appreciate the fact that you remembered - we want more of this, so don’t punish the mind for forgetting! If you practise this consistently then the periods of mind-wandering will eventually become shorter, and remembering will happen more frequently. Later still, forgetting will stop happening altogether - but there will still be thoughts present. \n\nSo, to summarise, don’t be concerned about thoughts. Have the intention to be conscious of the fact that you are meditating, and reward your mind each time it remembers that you should be meditating. Good luck!",

If it works out then great maybe it doesn't seem like that big of a sacrifice! If not, I tried and I can go back to enjoying recreational smoking.   \n  \nI understand struggling with placing a constraint on an aspect of your life (in this case both options are restraining you), so you have to weigh the outcomes. Will weed provide you with a lucrative career and income that this career might? Will this career provide you with the social connections and \\[insert other benefit here\\] that weed might?",

I used to smoke weed every day, that progressed to using other party drugs, E’s, coke, speed etc. I used to THINK I enjoyed all of those things, but substances only suit the situation THEY put you in. \n\nI am 6 years sober and clean, i no longer use any substances, and I go to the gym 3 days a week am a keen runner and love climbing, paddle boarding, scuba diving and many other activities. I have the job of my dreams, and keeping fit and staying away from substances has cured my anxiety, depression and have helped many aspects of my life. \n\nI left a lot of using friends behind, and once I stopped using they rarely contacted me any more. \n\nIt’s ok to change, to move on and leave things behind that no longer serve you well. If you have a choice between smoking a bit of weed to feel numb for a few hours, or stopping and getting the career of you dreams that’ll last a life time, the later is 100% a better investment in yourself, your future, your mind and your money. Your future self will thank you for putting down the weed, you’ll gain nothing by continuing to smoke it. Good luck ❤️",

Don't let the allure of the occasional good time deter you from advancing your life. I ended up going the less desirable, but only feasible route of joining the military. It was a shitty time, but I acknowledge the fact that it helped shape my life, taught me how to accept uncomfortable situations, and to use those situations to grow as a person. \n\nYou don't have to be a \"grindset\" bro about it and make personal and financial advancement your entire personality (personally, I find guys like that to be incredibly obnoxious, but to each their own), but I encourage you to consider that you may be letting fleeting moments of what you perceive to be pleasure to get in the way of you growing as a person and establishing happiness from within yourself.",

After you get the job, there’s a risk of being randomly drug tested, but that stuff only ever happens if someone suspects something and reports it. The take I have on it, is, use it as a rare treat, like a couple times a year if you can do so without any legal risk. I live in a state where it is decriminalized and legal medically. Once you’re in your job, they can’t fire you if they catch you the first time, you’d have to agree to get help/ go to treatment and complete that before you’d lose your job. It’s also highly unlikely you’d get caught if you’re smart about it. On the other side, that’s a lot of BS to have to go through if you do get caught, to smoke. I used to love the stuff, but I work in a profession that doesn’t want me doing that, and I gave it up. I have no desire to do it again. Not even a little bit. Being told you can’t ever do it is playing a factor into you wanting to do it even more. If you decide to do it on occasion once you get a job, I’d highly recommend keeping that information to yourself and not telling any coworkers.",

The tech industry values **skills over age**, and by the time you graduate, you’ll still have decades of career ahead of you.\n\nYour past mistakes don’t define your future—what matters is that you’ve found your way back and have the drive to do it right this time. It’s normal to compare yourself to others, but success isn’t a race. Many people who start young burn out or end up switching fields. You’re coming in with **more life experience and clarity**, which will help you stay focused and committed.\n\nAs for your relationship, open communication is key. If your girlfriend supports you now, she likely values you for who you are, not just your financial status. Show her that you’re serious about your future, and if she’s the right person, she’ll stay.\n\nYour 30s can be an amazing time to build a tech career. If you stay consistent, learn actively (especially outside of class), and work on projects or internships early, you’ll be in a great position by graduation. Don’t let doubt hold you back—this is your second chance, and you’re ready for it.",

    "text": "I just remembered one thing that made a really big difference to me - when I realised the extent that I had lost trust. \n\nSimply put, the mind generates thoughts because it believes it's what you need in order to stay safe. Fear is a protection mechanism designed to keep you safe. Fear hijacks the mind and the nervous system, and you end up reinforcing the experience. \n\nTo slow down thoughts, or even reduce their intensity or persuasiveness, I had to take a brave step and recognise that my mind was playing this story to me because it didn't trust in what is. It wanted to control everything all the time, which was why it was so busy all the time. For me to shift that way of being, I had to say to my mind \"I actually trust life without thought. I trust that if I stop thinking, the world will not crumble and fall apart, but will continue just fine. In fact, it will probably continue BETTER without my constant analysis and assessment of every situation than with them\".\n\nTrying to reduce overthinking without also addressing my own lack of trust in being thoughtless never stuck. I always ended up going back to old habits.\n\nI'll leave you with this to consider. When you get really tired, run down, sick, or just exhausted after using your brain for days on end, what's your cognitive ability like? It's crap, right? You can't process remotely complex thoughts when you're feeling like that. Some might call it 'brain fog'. \n\nConsider why that is - because the body is always in a state of self-preservation. When things are going well, all faculties are operational. But when resources get scare, the body will reprioritise functions to ensure your survival.\n\nIn other words, the body shuts down thought in order to ensure that you survive. Not only does this show that thought can't be an essential human function, but it almost suggests that the body recognises it can even be detrimental to our very survival. Ironic, given the story the mind tells us is that it's HELPING us survive.\n\nSo you see, you totally can trust yourself to live without needing your mind to constantly measure, assess, evaluate and analyse situations for potential threats. The question is, will your mind allow you to trust that?",

    "text": "First of all, I feel bad for you. I had the same feelings for years and years. And tried seeking help everywhere. But nothing really ever helped me.\n\nUntil I started to figure out these emotions and feelings were so present, because they were really demanded to be felt once and for all. Instead of finding tricks not to feel them, or just talking about them with a therapist. These trapped emotions need to be felt, which means you have to involve the body in this process.\n\nThis process is hard, yes it is. But when you practice how to feel (because trauma keeps the body in a non-feeling shutdown state) you will finally see, no FEEL, the difference. Slowly.\n\nDon’t overdo it too much. The body (and mind) are not used to that amount of feeling yet. So it can get overwhelmed.\n\nFind therapist/practioners who are specialised in techniques where the body is involved. Things as Somatic Experiencing, Breathwork, TRE, etc.\n\nConcluding, talking about your feelings is not a bad thing. It is very helpful. But we can not just talk our way out of feelings, we have to feel them. And then we can let go. The body will do it for you.\n\nWish you all the best.",

Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements.

Twenty nine is actually really young.\n\nI think you just have to realize that for some people it's easy, and for others it is not.  The idea that you screwed up your life is something you have to just thing about a maybe write down on paper.  People who get CS degrees (I did not) often get to be \"senior\" in four years after working.  If I were you, get your 4 year CS degree, work for four years, then if you are still committed and want to do a good job, you will be set.  I mean, as long as AI doesn't take all our jobs.\n\nRealistically you'll still need people to code, though AI is pretty amazing at helping out. If I were you I'd avoid the temptation to have it do all the coding for you.  Being a \"student\" at 30 only hurts your ego.  I would you prefer you to get humble now so you don't become one of those egomaniacs at work who think they know everything and won't help anyone else.  It's a blessing this is hurting your ego.

Someone says masculine = Confident while another says Feminine = Confident. It’s ultimately meaningless. \n\nMany times defining things as masculine and feminine have led to the oppression of people who are “feminine” or who do not perfectly fit into these defined terms.",

    "text": "Look up emotional regulation, somatic exercises, and grounding. I’ll give a disclaimer that I haven’t been doing this for very long so I’m not sure if it’s because it’s working or if I had a sudden turnaround in a matter of a couple weeks (unlikely I would assume) but I was highly anxious and extremely hurt and angry over a trauma that somebody caused me and I’m starting to feel better, letting it go, and almost even forgiving them. \n\nJust weeks ago I hated this person, was consumed by my anger and pain, and could not imagine forgiveness EVER, much less this soon. I’m not done healing by any means, I’m not done being angry, and I haven’t released everything so I’m not claiming to be miraculously cured but I do think I’m on my way and I’ve been more mindful of how I feel and I get less stuck on negative feelings when they come. \n\nStart just a little at a time even a few minutes a day if that’s all you can manage. I get easily overwhelmed by adding things to my plate so I never wanted to start but I convinced myself that just a few minutes is all it takes and that’s what I stick to. If I can do more I do, if I can’t oh well, that’s ok. I will also say that somatic exercises are known to help “dislodge” trauma and emotions that your body is holding onto so research that to see if it’s right for you because initially (happening to me now) it can cause your emotions to come up suddenly and you may not be ready for that. Take it slow and do what you can, be compassionate to yourself. I wish you the best and healing vibes 🩵",

In fact, worrying ensures you feel LESS safe, and CAUSES more pain. \n\nSomewhere along the way, you need to accept that the mind does not have the capacity to guide you to safety. The mind is a tool that we have been given to help us solve problems. Only, somewhere along the way we buy into its story a little too much and decide that what it tells us is ENTIRELY what reality is. We believe that thinking is necessary and keeps us safe. We have no trust in our ability to be able to survive in life when we don't think. \n\nAt some point, we need to learn to trust in a life free of mind. That's not to say that we should expect to live with a silent mind. Just that when we accept that the mind has an appalling track record of causing a disproportionately high amount of unnecessary suffering, we begin to realise that maybe it's not the almighty, all powerful, all knowing demigod it tells us that it is.  \n\nTo learn to trust in life without mind takes courage, but in my experience was absolutely necessary for me to begin to break free of its all-encompassing, energy-sapping story of eternal deprivation, victimhood, and self-loathing.",

I have also trained my brain to defocus my eyes and block anything that is triggering - really helps.\n\n  \nWhat I am finding more and more are groups forming their own social platforms based on hobbies and activities.    I also like that the folks running these are passionate and invested in growing the community.  They are typically free, but have a pay plan that provide additional content.  I subscribe because I not only want these groups to succeed, but I find the additional content well done.  I find folks on these type of groups - shared passions, activities, with a leader and moderator who care - to be very mentally safe. Even positive influences.\n\n  \nSo I am focusing on hobbies, local events, activities I care about (e.g.: climate change), and groups I value (e.g.: I follow Jesus, so I search for understanding particularly around the Sermon on the Mount (brilliant teaching on how to live a well lived life...relevant to anyone from one of the most amazing teachers...there are several amazing online social groups that fill many happy hours).\n\n  \nPerhaps folks should get together and form their own social groups and then we can federate together.\n\n  \nWELL DONE ON YOUR EFFORTS!!!",

It was talking about sleep, and it got to talking about how our brains are built to wander, they are meant to be bored. When we have quiet, down time our brains will process through thoughts and kinda work through everything weighing on the mind. \n\nIn today's day and age, we are always actively doing something: talking to people at work, looking at screen, listening to music in car, probably have earbuds in with a podcast or music when walking, driving, or doing chores. What happens is that we lay down to go to sleep, and it's the first time our brains have been allowed to wander all day, and then you have the \"I can't fall asleep because my brain won't shut up!\" Well, of course it won't, you haven't let it talk all day!\n\nSo, anyway, all that to say... sometimes going on the walk just to listen to the birds or other ambient noises, and letting your brain wander, can still be helpful.",

If it is, start building the tools first you'll need to support what you're sedating for when it's no longer sedated.\n\n\nIt's a big shift. Sometimes you need to learn a new support structure, have a plan, and then just one day decide from this moment on no more X (not tomorrow), and ensure you don't go overkill replacing it with something equally hard to quit. Or just be mindful if you are how that may be an issue too. Many people quitting smoking or drinking supplement the dopamine with eating and smoking weed for example.\n\n\nDon't let your mind and cravings bargain with you once you've started.  But also don't set yourself up for failure by doing more than you can handle at a time you might burnout and binge like crazy when you give in.",

The secret is in what we're doing right here - being authentic and vulnerable, sharing our experiences without being guarded or worrying what people might think. \n\nOf course having developed a habit of putting on a front makes it a challenge to truly be genuine. And it helps if you're in the company of people who are trying to do the same thing but it's not a requirement. When you're authentic people tend to connect with that.\n\nI first started understanding this while participating in some online experiences where I would share vulnerably with strangers.

But because of language, we tend to separate the experience into “thinker” and “thoughts”—as if there’s a person in our head having thoughts.\n\nBut can you have a thinker without any thoughts? Isn’t the idea of a “thinker” just another thought?\n\nRather than splitting things into “who’s thinking?” or “who’s listening?”, you can simply notice: thinking is happening. It’s a process—just like breathing, seeing, hearing, feeling. All of it comes and goes.\n\nThoughts arise and pass away. Emotions arise and pass away. Even choices and actions arise in the same way. Everything is unfolding, moment by moment.\n\nHope that makes sense!",

    "text": "Hello!\n\nLook at your direct experience of life as if you were looking at it for the first time. Probably there is a feeling “I am in this body, perceiving a world outside of myself.” But notice this is not actually your direct experience. It is not important to debate whether or not that is really the case - either way, it isn’t our direct experience. Our direct and immediate experience is that everything is an object of perception. The body, the mind, the world, all of it is being perceived. Clearly, you exist. And clearly, you are perceiving this body, this mind, and this world. Mindfulness is basically just viewing experience from this perspective. It’s a zooming out, a dis-identifying from the “I am a person in the world” and instead taking your stand as what you are in your own direct experience: the perceiver of all of it. \n\nHow does this help? It brings us into the correct relationship with the mind, as an object of perception rather than *what we are*. And the gap which this shift opens up is very significant because it essentially cuts off the mind’s sole power source - namely our exclusive fascination in its content. Our experience switches from “I am anxious” to “I exist, and I am perceiving anxiety.” If you practice this consistently then the mind gradually loses its ability to pull you in - you start having a choice to stand back and watch it with increasing equanimity.",

    "text": "Hello Substantial-Host2263, \n\nNot sure whether I can write everything in an succinct and orderly manner, but I'll try to keep it as close to an outline format as possible. I'll try to cover topics like why that feeling happens, what the cause is, how to address it. The objective of this comment will be for you to not suffer, so if you feel that you are not suffering, or do not wish to resolve suffering, then you can stop reading here. \n\nThe reason humans want to hurt themselves is because they have categorized themselves into a category that should be harmed. \n\nThis is because we have created a situation where we want to create things that can be harmed, mainly, because we want things that shouldn't be harmed. Our whole journey in life is to try to get ourselves into this category of things-that-shouldn't-be-harmed (aka 'loved') by ourselves. Unfortunately, if we are unable to see ourselves, we can't love ourselves, and since we can't see ourselves, we can't love ourselves. The only true way to get  out of this is, obviously, love ourselves by realizing that we exist, even if we can't see ourselves, but more on that later. \n\nSince we can't see ourselves in order to love ourselves, even though we unconsciously know that we exist, we come to believe that we do not love ourselves despite the fact that we exist. This means that we are someone who is able to love something that exists, but is not choosing to love ourselves. \n\nHow, then, do we come to love ourselves when we are choosing to not love ourselves? The solution to this is the problem you (/we all) have. The solution we came up with is \"if we are valuable, then I will love myself, and the reason I don't love myself, is because I'm not valuable\". There is no foundation to this, this is a vacuous belief, and there is no reason why something that isn't showing love to something that exists (the most, and only valuable 'thing' in this universe), would then choose to love something just it memorized a few tricks, but since we are desperate, that is what we came to believe. \n\nThus, we begin our journey to collect valuable things/knowledge/achievements/skills/personalities, hoping that if we get a good enough job, if we read enough books, if we are kind enough, if we are successful enough, if we have enough, then, we will finally categorize ourselves as something valuable, and finally, we would love ourselves. \n\nOf course, anything we gather in this physical world after birth, is not 'me'; they are simply decorations, and all decorations fall off, and they are impermanent. We're just putting water soluble paint on a canvas before the inevitable rain to remind us that we are still a blank canvas. \n\nSo, knowing this, we know that nothing we actually do in this physical world will actually get ourselves to love ourselves. And as we age, and get closer to death, this becomes more and more apparent. We realize that nothing we gain in any way shape or form is actually making us any more valuable then the day we were born, which means we won't be able to love ourselves if we continue to believe in the belief that \"valuable things will be loved, and non-valuable things will not be loved.\" \n\n(comment was too long to post, will divide into 2 parts)",

    "text": "(Part 2)\n\nHowever, most of us have lived too long. Most of us have lost too much of our life to actually come to realize that this belief was wrong; that going to school, buying things, learning things, doing things was all for nothing, and we will never be relieved of this suffering that we had from birth (well, since before the creation of the universe, but, within the scope of this comment: 'since you were born' will suffice). But we don't want to believe we wasted our life, for that is the pinnacle of 'something that is not valuable'; to have depleted what is valuable, in order to gain many non-valuable (impermanet) objects and ideas!\n\nOur only way to believe that we got SOMETHING that is correct, and also to not believe that we have COMPLETELY wasted our life, we cling on to the belief that the belief of \"valuable things are loved and non-valuable things are not loved\" is not incorrect, that this is in fact correct, and this is in fact truth, and we have in fact used our life on the basis of truth, and not a vacuous lie we have told ourselves. \n\nBut, of course, since this was a lie, and we know it, and we know that pursuing this will not result in ourselves  loving ourselves, we must vehemently convince ourselves that it is true. \n\nSo, how do we continue to live our life to make sure we do not for a second doubt that the belief of \"valuable things are loved and non-valuable things are not loved\"? We ure our body and mind to practice this. \n\nWhat are we? Well, as we have decided at around the age of 3, we are: \"not valuable things\"\n\nSo, how are not valuabe things treated? They are hated (ignored, abused, violated, disregarded, disposed). \n\nThat is why you are treating yourself the way you are, and you also believe that harming yourself is the correct thing to do, the right thing to do, the obvious option to perform, natural thing to do, etc. \n\nSo, how do you get out of this? \n\nSimple: \n\nShow love, respect, attention, care to ALL THINGS \\*NOT\\* based on some random characteristics that they may or may not have at any given moment (since those are all temporary), and instead, love, respect and pay attention to them for simply the fact that they are. \n\nAnd spend about 1000x more hours/days/years spent on this relative to the amount of hours/day/years that you've spent on practicing the belief of \"I will love/hate some things based on what properties/characteristics I believe it has\"\n\nAs you have practiced this belief on every homeless person you've see, on every piece of trash, on every disrespectful/violent person, as you have showed this to every cheap things throughout your life, spend about 1000x the time on showing love and respect to any homeless person, every piece of trash, every violent/disrespectful person, any and every cheap objects, \n\nThen, slowly, this new thought process will become 'normal'. Then, when it becomes normal, and effortless, and obvious, and frankly the only way  your mind is able to operate, then, and only then, will you never think that 'harming yourself' is an viable option. \n\n  \nI'll have to cut this short here, please let me know if you have any further questions about how to actually  do this, what sort of things you could expect, or how to address any specific circumstances. \n\n  \nKind regards, \n\n55hikky55",

    "text": "This is something that gets overlooked quite a lot. Having someone that you can relate to is a deep desire for everyone. Especially when it comes to difficult emotions. The problem is that consistently seeking the relation will keep you in the muck and make it hard to break away from those bad emotions. \n\nAnxiety and depression are both things that I struggle with on and off. It feels nice when you can talk to someone and have the commonality but it can be a slippery slope where those feelings become the basis for a lot of conversations. Always bringing them up and bouncing them off one another CAN help, but not all the time. I think it’s important to not become stuck in that place and to fight tooth and nail to get away from it.",

OP bears their heart out and commenters respond with kindness and support.\n\nBut what does the next step look like? Mental health treatment varies from individual to individual. There's no silver bullet to feeling less shitty with your lot in life.\n\nPeople that made it to the other side can _try_ to communicate their journey, but they're doing so to people feeling at their lowest. It comes off as trite platitudes or toxic positivity, mostly because they haven't had that perspective changing epiphany. It's a \"If you know, you know\" type of situation.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it's like weight loss subs. When you lose weight, you feel awesome. If not, you get kinda resentful of other people's progress.\n\nThat said, you can balance out the mental health subs with therapy subs. The right combination is a bit of trial & error, though.\n\nFWIW, I like this sub because it's neutral enough to move the needle, in my book.",

On the other hand, you will find other people around you are not bothered. \n\nso its important to not  hear the music or pay attention to it as its not in your control.  The first moment you hear it is when you have power to ignore it or accept the toll.   Dont label it. Simply recognise it and move on. \n\nThe same thing goes about bugs and insects.

Subscribing and having them show up in my feed just magnifies the things in my own life that don’t need magnification. \n\nSpending time reading books or watching highly informative content (I found Robert Sapolky’s lectures on depression useful) has been a far better use of time. \n\nSo many of the things I struggle with boil down to habits and patterns of thought. If I spend time in spaces filled with other people playing out the same patterns, it just reinforces the seeming realness of my own instead of allowing me to move away from it.\n\nGood post.",

If you see things through a biased lens, you'll only feel like a victim. Your not a victim. Neither are things better or worse for others. Perspective vs reality. That's the defining factor.\n\n\nThe truth is you don't need to identify with all these labels : worthy, loved, better, etc. Just do what you gotta do to survive. And take care of your health, because ill health only hurts u. Healthy body gives freedom to explore life, travel. That better future exists here in the present moment, where you're earning for yourself by working hard like a good person. You're doing good. Save money. Then you can move some place where it's safe and civilised. \n\n\nI watched this video. https://youtu.be/izTvvqKx9cA?si=5PeynkIm830ANeWS\nIt's inspiring to see, that if they can be happy and accepting of their situation, so can we all. \n\n\nAnd trust me... If you're on social media a lot, minimising your use of it will significantly improve your mood. Others have experienced this. Most social media content is fake, but makes u compare yourself to fabricated ideals. Then you become dissatisfied with own life, even when everything is ok.",

    "text": "You know, what you are feeling is very normal. It is very common, when we try to affirm self-love, to kind of get almost the opposite effect. This happens when we hold deep unconscious beliefs of inadequacy.\n\nThe mindful way to deal with this is a little different than what is commonly thought.\n\nFirst, instead of self-love, you can try self-compassion. Just feeling compassion for your suffering. Self-compassion does not need judgment. We are all worthy of it.\n\nIn ACT, a type of mindfulness-based therapy, we have this beautiful exercise that you can try to feel compassion on an embodied level: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU653hj8JDE&ab\\_channel=LivingByCommittedACTion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU653hj8JDE&ab_channel=LivingByCommittedACTion)\n\nSecond, mindfulness teaches us not to try to disprove our thoughts of unworthiness (at least not when they are strong), but to observe them with equanimity. It teaches us to change how we relate to them.\n\nI personally used to suffer with a lot of negative self-thoughts, and I remember years ago a moment when things started to shift: it was a moment when I became able to accept these thoughts, and even welcome them, as an old friend that has been with me for a long time.

    "text": "Hello! Thanks for posting this. I think you already have a great deal of insight into your own predicament.\n\nYou’ve mentioned liberation, so I’ll respond in that context. Ultimately we could say that there is no real liberation, because there isn’t anyone who could ever be liberated - but there is certainly an apparent process towards apparent liberation as long as there appears to be a person who could be liberated! I think that everything you’ve described here is really just a part of that process. Each person has their own unique bundle of conditioning, like a piece of paper that has been scrunched up into a ball in its own unique way. The path towards liberation is essentially an unfolding of that scrunched up ball of conditioning, and as the conditioning is unique to the individual, so must its unfolding also be unique. Feeling stuck, confused, frustrated, etc. are all very much part of that unfolding process. There have been many times in my life when I have felt that I wasn’t making progress, and only years later have I been able to look back and see from a more zoomed-out perspective how those experiences were an integral part of my path. \n\nI’m not sure that you really need any advice here other than to say that you’re already doing it, keep going! Just do what you can do, when you can do it. Continue to be aware when you can and continue to investigate your own experience as much as you’re able. Wishing you the best!",

Thank you for making yourself vulnerable and bringing up the subject. \n\nYou can't \"love yourself\" when your next thought is I hate myself and these rich people are happy and look down on me. It's never ever going to change. You can already tell, you've probably been feeling like this for a long time. \n\nThe thing that's most important to understand here at first is that your desire to feel better and your feeling horrible go hand in hand. No one ever wants to feel horrible about themselves, so like some have said here, this is a very common response.\n\nNow what to do. You want to be able to see all of this drama unfolding in front of your eyes while you're feeling this terrible feeling. Stay with me please. The next time this feeling reoccurs, watch your feelings and see how as soon as this situation happens your feelings automatically go South.\n\nYou'll have to watch this a few times, maybe many times. Soon you'll get a realization that you are not the one reacting, but that there is a \"deeper\" you,  the you who is seeing your ego react like that. It's very subtle and  most importantly it's not an intellectual understanding. It will be a realization.\n\nIf at this point your mind has decided these instructions are already worthless, know that it's the same mind that gets lost in anger and worthlessness.\n\nJust try that, please OP. If it works I'll be happy to share the next steps. But this should carry you very far to a much better state of mind. Cheers!",

    "text": "I think you’re misunderstanding a couple of critical pieces here! Mindfulness should improve both planning and decision making. Let’s talk about approaches.\n\n‘Nonjudgmental’ is not about not having preferences, but rather about not attaching emotional or value judgments to your thoughts. If you’re hungry, that’s important to be aware of. If you have feeling associated with hunger, you want to be aware of those feelings too. You want to be mindful of the sensation of hunger and any associated feelings. \n\nYou absolutely do want to listen to your body signals, and as your mindfulness and self-awareness improve, so should your attunement to your body sensations, like hunger. There’s nothing about mindful behavior that suggests you should delay eating when you are hungry.\n\nWhat you don’t want do is, as a random example of non-judgement, is beat yourself up because you don’t think you should be hungry. You don’t wanna think that you’re stupid or bad or fat or etc. Having judgment is still very important! Being mindful should help you make good choices! Mindfulness should help you develop objectivity and recognize the difference between your thoughts, emotions, and decisions, on the one hand, and who you are, on the other.\n\nLikewise, you can mindfully plan for the future. If you decide that it’s important to set aside time to think about an upcoming trip, or saving for retirement, or what time you need to get up for class tomorrow, being ‘in the present’ doesn’t mean that you’re not thinking about the future or taking time to plan. It simply means that you are self-aware, mindful, as you’re thinking about the future.\n\nMindfulness is not navel-gazing. It does not mean that you just sit, focused inwardly, and not doing things. You want to be as high-performing of an individual as you can be, while at the same time developing objectivity and awareness about your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings.",

You seem to have some thoughts that are worth questioning: are those families really perfect, or is it possible if not very likely they have their own struggles they’re dealing with? Is it even possible to have a perfect life without any struggles? Would such a life even be desirable, without any challenges to overcome? You describe yourself as pathetic and worthless, which is the same way I describe myself, but is that really true? Why, and based on what standards? If I was in your shoes coming to you for advice, would you think I’m pathetic & worthless? We are frankly all strange creatures, aren’t we? Life’s quite a strange and intricate thing- you and I are sitting probably thousands of miles apart yet dealing with much the same thoughts. \n\nI hope you hear something that I’ve only realized myself recently: you are not messed up. Do me a favor and take just a moment to suspend all disbelief, close your eyes, and really just sit with the possibility that you are fine as you are. Do not try or force yourself to believe this- instead just sit with it and let the doubts and other negative thoughts slip away, because as you question them you may realize how silly they are. There’s nothing inherently wrong with you or the world around you. You and the world simple exist as you are.\n\nIn my opinion, trying to love yourself and positive affirmations are a bit of a sham, because you’re trying to convince yourself of something that you just don’t believe. I have found it more helpful to instead sit with and question whether any of those negative beliefs really have much weight rather than trying to fight or resist them. \n\nWe’re here for you, mate. Remember that you’re worthy as you are, and you’ll be far ahead of most people if you understand this. I can tell you I know many people who make a whole lot of money who are also just chasing a desire to feel worthy, but they won’t find it there.",

    "text": "You’re describing something I struggled with understanding as I was working on mindfulness myself. I realized that mindfulness does not equate to complacency or indifference. It’s about simply accepting yourself, your thoughts and desires, and reality as it is in a nonjudgmental way. \n\nTo extend the example, it’s to recognize “Hm, I’m feeling hungry right now, and gosh I’m really craving some pizza.”You might think to yourself, “Ugh, I’m so fat and unhealthy for craving this all the time.” There are many mindful approaches, but some examples might be “You know what, I’m feeling hungry, and it’s normal and natural to crave this kind of food, I’m not fat or unhealthy to desire it” and (1) “I’ve been exercising and eating healthy all week, so I will choose to go ahead and eat the pizza this time” OR (2) “you know, I had these same thoughts yesterday and ended up eating a bunch of Oreos, so I will hold off on pizza now, because I know it’ll make me feel crummy to eat something unhealthy.” This doesn’t end here though. If you end up caving and eating the unhealthy thing, you don’t chastise yourself and judge yourself as bad and weak for caving, but think “ok, I caved this time when I didn’t want to and it made me feel crummy, but I’ll remember how this made me feel so it might help guide my decisions in the future. \n\nIt seems so silly that I just wrote a whole paragraph about choosing whether or not to eat pizza, yet the reality is that people judge themselves for these choices rather than just accepting what happens without making it a stain on their character.",

    "text": "Mindfulness is about going through life thoughtfully but without holding onto judgment. It’s not about accepting a bug stinging you, but about accepting reality without the resistance of judging actions as good or bad. So, in this case, you might be mindful that it is in the mosquito’s nature to sting, to not hold animosity against it, but you can choose whether to swat at it or tolerate it. If you swat at it and kill it, you can be mindful of that and regret it, but not necessarily judge yourself for being a bad person to have killed it. If you let it sting you, you might mindfully accept what happened instead of judgmental thinking “I’m so stupid for letting it sting me.” Does that make sense? Like [the two monks crossing the river](https://external-preview.redd.it/6_vTO6ZFuIWgJnuVuZYxY2BRYta9rBmrUB5KV_l3CoE.jpg?auto=webp&s=278858d63807a220222d277927f022699f10d4eb), it’s about not holding on to the emotional weight and judgment of an action once it has passed.",

Things change, and trying to hold onto something that no longer serves you isn't mindful, and really isn't good for you.\n\nAdditionally, it seems you're a little overly dependent on weed, in my opinion, that you feel the need to use it as a crutch to get that \"carefree\" feeling. I think it's a powerful opportunity to grow, and learn how to do that naturally, without getting high. The fact that you're considering medication that will help you use marijuana again because you want to use it so badly, sounds like a red flag to me a little as far as being too dependent.",

    "text": "I think whether therapy is a help or hinderance to your practice will largely depend on the specific therapy modality, the therapist and how therapy shifts your relationship to whatever you're looking to work on. As I understand it, the aim from a mindful perspective would be to shift your relationship to your trauma towards equanimity from its position of aversion/attachment, in other words, to be able to view your trauma as if it weren't \"yours.\"\n\nRenunciation, depending on how you understand it, could make one more averse towards their trauma. Instead of identifying as \"the one who this trauma happened to\" it could cause you to identify as \"the one who renounced this trauma\", just trading one identification for another.\n\nAs far as specific therapy modalities, personally, I find Rogerian or client-centered therapy to be useful and complimentary to spirituality but it will depend a lot on your disposition and the therapist (it's best to find a therapist that has \"done their own work\" and gone through therapy themselves.)",

    "text": "I have a huge let-down of an answer for you and an explanation of why it's the best possible answer.\n\nThe reason you feel that need is because you feel that need.\n\nHow's that for a let-down? It sounds extremely silly, right? Don't we need to figure out more details to be able to do something about it? Everyone would agree to that, wouldn't they? Understand what's going on so you can change it.\n\nThere's one big problem with that: not everything that goes on in our minds is visible to us. We have what's called conscious experience: the things we know are going on. Thoughts, feelings, sensations in the body (butterflies in stomach, that sort of thing)... the whole works. But, obviously, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. How does your mind allow you to speak in complete and mostly coherent sentences without you having to think about grammar and pronunciation and intonation and all that fun stuff? No idea, right? It just happens.\n\nThe same applies to basically everything. You don't have to think about tying your shoelaces... and, ironically, often when people do start thinking about it while trying to teach it to their kids, they get confused and briefly stop being able to tie their own shoelaces! That's because the mind has, over time, from a bunch of repetitions, built an optimized \"program\" for tying shoelaces which doesn't require conscious intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes the mind builds programs that aren't so great, e.g. a program to feel like you need to always be doing things for other people. Now, you never actually sat down and constructed that program... it's something that the mind extracted as a pattern from part of your personal history.\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that these patterns aren't based on reason. A large part of what the mind does is spotting patterns. The mind spotted a pattern and assimilated it. Trying to reason with the pattern will lead nowhere, because reason never had anything to do with it (you can totally build new bad programs with the \"help\" of reason, but that's a different topic). The pattern building in the mind is almost completely disconnected from the part of the mind that handles reasoning and analysis (\"thinking about things\").\n\nAll of the programs aren't connected to each other, either. That's why you can feel like it's totally fine for others to \"be useless\" (to put it in uncharitable terms), but feel very differently about yourself. Two programs that have the same general topic but no actual touchpoints in your mind, made out of different \"data\", maybe even at different times.  Sometimes programs are situational, too: you can very confident and capable in many situations, but in some random other situations you might feel very different. Again, this has nothing to do with reason, it's just programs that the mind has extracted from whatever.\n\nNow, what most people do is start thinking about what's going on and why it's going on, and maybe feel bad about feeling bad, berate themselves, feel like they're a bit stupid. Inevitably they'll make up all kinds of conclusions: it's because my parents didn't love me. It's because I got rejected by my person X when I was younger when I didn't want to help them. Etc. Etc. Of course there's no way to verify these conclusions... it might sound extremely plausible that this is what the mind used for input to make the program, but you couldn't exactly *prove* it. Even if you could... so what?\n\nBuilding these conclusions doesn't alter the program... it creates a new one on top. Now, when you feel those feelings, the new program gets kicked off too: on top of the feelings, you'll start recalling all the thoughts you've already built about how you \"know\" the cause. The next program you'll build is feeling frustrated about not being able to solve the issue even though you \"understand\" it. Before you know it, you've built dozens of new programs and all of them together make the problem seem like an even bigger problem than it was when you started out. This is the inevitable result of trying to analyze everything as a means of solving a problem that never had anything to do with reason in the first place.\n\nSo, any more detailed answer to your question would actually hinder you more than it would help you. Make sense?\n\nWhat *really* needs to happen, of course, is for the mind to \"lose\" these programs. I don't know of a way to make this happen all by your lonesome as if by magic. There are various therapeutic approaches, of course, but sadly therapy isn't something you can do on your own. Unless real therapy is something you're willing to look into (and it can totally be worth it), that leaves us with the boring, non-magical approach, which is... mindfulness. A shocking twist, right?\n\nMindfulness boils down to not feeding the programs with extra attention and focus. Staying present and not trying to change, control, ignore, or even judge the feelings... that's what makes programs malleable again. If I'm dealing with old feelings I can't seem to shake off, the way I make it easier to get in the right state of mind is to think of them as echoes from the past: rehashed thoughts that are not necessarily good or bad in and of themselves, not necessarily right or wrong, just something that I've \"learned\" and that will rework itself into something new if I just let it happen at its own pace. That doesn't mean it'll go away immediately, and it doesn't mean I'll get exactly the outcome I'm expecting... but the most important thing is that it starts being open to change, and I resist the temptation of micromanaging (or even managing) the process.\n\nMaybe it sounds a bit cheesy, but I truly believe that the mind is very, very good at adapting... you just have to get rid of the obstacles, and the way is to stop treating all those old programs as truth. Let them happen until they change, see what comes after, repeat. They *will* change, it's inevitable. The only way they won't change is if you keep trying to deal with them in exactly the same way you have in the past.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions or doubts.",

Then when people let you down, just accept that that's the way it is, and move on with your life in the new reality you live in, knowing what you know now. \n\nIt may never stop hurting us when we think of it from time to time, but we just have to accept the hurt as a part of our experience, and know that it will pass and something else will take it's place in our thoughts and emotions at another point in time.\n\nYou don't need to forgive in the sense that you don't hold it against them, but you should work toward letting it go, because you don't deserve to carry the weight of their bad behavior. That's their responsibility.",

    "text": "Instead of seeing it as being religious maybe try to see it differently. Try viewing it as though you are in a relationship with Jesus. See him as your best friend that only wants what is best for you. That will listen to your hurts and struggles and upsets AND your happy days too though. See God as being your perfect father. One who will never leave you, one who will forgive you as far as the east is from the west, and one who will NEVER stop loving you no matter how many times you mess up. Then see the Holy Spirit as your personal guardian angel. One who will guide you and comfort you and wrap their wings around you when you need to be held. The Bible says that God will not give you more than you can bear. You will bear as much as you can and then hand the rest over to God. He wants us to. He doesn’t want you to suffer, He wants you to trust that He will take care of you. The longer you hold onto it (anxieties, worries, stresses) the more you will suffer. Sometimes I have to close my eyes and imagine myself reaching out to him to give him the stress and anxiety that weighs me down. Once I let it go and breathe through it, my body physically feels lighter, my heart slows back down, the shaking stops and I can relax. My panic goes away",

Honestly, a lot of organized religions can do the opposite of their intent, and A LOT of them love using guilt. It's not healthy. Personally, I feel connected when I'm out in nature more than when I'm in a building. God is everywhere; find him where it feels right for you. And guilt should never be a part of it. Be kind to yourself. Take a deep breath. You are not alone. You are always connected. Forgive yourself if there is something to forgive. But give yourself some grace.",

Stuff happens, then we become aware the potentially detrimental effect it has on us, then we try to work this away but all we are ever doing is building corrective layer upon corrective layer.

But you already know this, right? When our overall nervous system is more at ease, even mosquito bites don't bother us so much...\n\nMeditation just seems to show us that more clearly.\n\nThis may sound strange, but my best advice would be to take care of yourself, to practice self-compassion, to acknowledge how hard it is to have all that is going on in your life already, and then having to cope with those annoying mosquitoes on top of that, almost as if they become the straw that breaks the camel's back...\n\nSo, most of all, my best advice: bug spray and mosquito nets! ;)",

Are you 100% sure that’s what’s right for you?\n\nI understand your situation—I’ve been in toxic relationships too. At a certain point, I realized that forcing forgiveness wasn’t working for me because I wasn’t affected by their wrongdoings anymore. For instance, think about a mosquito biting you—do you ever really forgive a mosquito? Sometimes, you just accept that it happened.\n\nAlso, consider this: hurting someone in retaliation when you’ve been hurt is very different from being the one who hurt someone first. Acknowledging our own mistakes in relationships often leads to harsh self-judgment, based on theoretical values rather than the reality of our experience.\n\nFor me, the breakthrough came when I stopped chasing forgiveness as a goal and started focusing on accepting where I am right now—flaws and all. Self-development isn’t a destination; it’s an ongoing journey. The more we work on ourselves and transform our lives, the more forgiveness naturally follows, without having to force it.\n\nI hope this makes sense. It’s a stream of consciousness - my favorite guru  :)",

I know some people have combined office entertainment spaces, but personally that wouldn't work for me. \n\n\n\n-i don't have push notifications set up for any of my work emails or apps. I always think it's funny when people are like \"oh I'm gonna be so checked out on vacation, I'm turning off my email notifications!\" I always think, I don't even have those turned on normally 😅 This may be workplace dependent though. I have apps on my phone so if I have to step away from my desk I can check every 5-10 minutes, but when I'm not working, I don't look at my emails or chats at all. Though I am not a supervisor and I have never been asked to turn push notifications on \n\n\n\n-i try to go for a walk after I get off of work. Or go sit outside for a bit. This is especially true because I WFH, so if I don't force myself to do that some days I just don't leave the house the entire day. It helps me wind down, appreciate the world around me, and mentally note that the work day is over \n\n\n\n-breathing exercises and stepping away from my desk when I get overwhelmed or frustrated. This may not be as easy to do if not working from home, but I appreciate the ability to just walk away if I find myself getting upset about something.

Basically you journal daily, not about facts but about your feelings, emotions, you dump your gut feeling on a paper. 10-15 minutes daily.\n\nEmotions are body signals, so look out for any uncomfortable body sensations, like tension in legs, belly or solar plexus.\n\nAs for escape/coping methods - it's not your fault. Our culture is build of coping and escapism. Video games, 99% of films, tv shows, social media is one big stream of distraction helping you run away from what's inside.",

    "text": "Being one with the truth helps more than anything. You have to accept the reality of this world. Both pleasant and unpleasant things exist in the world. If you try to use positive content to feel like everything's ok, you'll just be deluding yourself temporarily. But then when faced with the darker facets of the world, you may come crashing down, fall apart. Instead, accept the truth. Acceptance is liberating. Furthermore, using positive content for reassurance is like an addictive drug. Everytime you need comfort, you'll be looking for positive stuff. I want you to know that you're inherently powerful. You can be productive and take action if you want to. Only intent matters. \nYou don't need temporary reassurance.\n\n\n\n\nYou're living on a planet in space, around which asteroids and other cosmic bodies float around, explosions happen here and there. Chaos is natural. We're a part of that chaos. History has been full of it. We're living in stable times compared to the past 100 years. Everything is ok if you're ok.\n\n\nIf you have your basic necessities met, everything is ok. Already. Any overthinking will always create anxiety because that's what overthinking does. So overthinking is the issue. Buddhism is great for such issues. It teaches us to be in the present moment, where we exist. When you watch anything troubling, the stress and anxiety is caused by your mind shifting to the thinking state rather than being \"in the moment\" state. Practice mindfulness. Learn about it. Zen Buddhism too. Really study this wisdom and apply to your life. It'll help you reframe your mind, so that you are no longer bothered by external factors (be it life situations or media content). \nWhy do you think Buddhist monks and ppl who practice it are so much at peace and calm, mentally resilient? \n\n\nI also advise you to avoid consuming content that doesn't relate to you. If it's news from places you're not living in, don't watch it. Anything fictional that's negative emotions inducing. Don't watch it. Reason?  Our brains were never meant to be cluttered with so much info. Our brains work well when they're empty-ish. So don't expose yourself to unnecessary content. Be mindful what you watch. Set boundaries here. It'll help your mental state.",

They come in all shapes and sizes. \n\nThey look different from far away. And so is the case with man remember! They look different from far away. The closer you come the less difference. The day the woman is yours suddenly you say she is after all a woman. And he is after all a man. \n\nThis you have been doing for many millions of lives. This is what we call in India the wheel of life and death, the wheel of desire. And you know it! You have known it many ways. You are hankering for a car and the day the car is on your porch suddenly all joy is gone. What to do now? 1 day, 2 days, 3 days you enjoy the thrill of the new, then it becomes old. But you never find out the mind that is causing trouble for you. \n\nThe source of all anguish. The mind is never satisfied with that which is. This is the source of discontent. The mind is always asking for that which is not. Look at this absurdity. The mind ALWAYS asks for THAT WHICH IS NOT! And is always dissatisfied with that which is. Now how you can be happy with this mind? Wherever you are you will be unhappy. Unhappiness follows mind like a shadow. \n\nSo rather than going on changing things, see into the whole phenomenon of it. And if you really want to change, drop this mind. And with the dropping of the mind each moment is such a joy and such a contentment. Yes, it will be very, very difficult for you to believe but let me say it. Let it be on record. \n\nIf you drop the mind you will be simply surprised you are again in life, even with your own wife. With the dropping of the mind you simply become love. One flows in love. No more she will be your wife, no more you will be her husband. These are ugly things. This should not happen in a better world. With a better consciousness these things should disappear. \n\nTo reduce a woman to a wife is ugly and immoral. This is confining. This is defining. This is making a phenomenon very limited. A woman is a mystery, so is a man. Don‘t call her your wife, she is not yours. And she is not a wife, a wife is a function. That is not her totality. She is many more things. She is not finished by being a wife.“\n\n~ Osho",

I've experienced the same thing.\n\nAfter discovering the relative ease with which we can feel deep happiness, meaning and fulfillemnt through practice alone, chasing outside things for happiness feels way too clunky, as if the energy investment is not worth the reward.\n\nIt feels like the very striving for something other than this moves me away from sensitivity and peace instead of towards it. I don't think the average person really stops to reflect on what happiness means and what's the best way to achieve it; they sort of just go with the wave of social convention and just assume there's nothing better, no higher meaning or possibility. Zero probing, examination, investigation.\n\nIf practice is a priority to you then it's just a matter of shaping your life/environment in a way that allows your energy to flow towards meditation and awareness with few distractions. There will be sacrifices no matter what you choose, but if it's truly what you want then the sacrifice won't feel like a heavy burden at all, as you're deeply reaping the rewards of this lifestyle every day.",

The familiar strain: losing weight, not eating, bulge in the gut, lethargy. I took him to the vet and there was a treatment path, but it fell outside the parameters I've set for cost, complication, and quality of life. \n\nThe key is: the parameters *I've* set. The decision was up to *me*. *I* decide, no one else. *I* take the flak, no one else. There are no stone tablets laying out the rules, no You Tube video to tell me how to decide yes or no. No god to do the deed. It's messy, on the fly, and do not let anyone convince you these moments can be scripted or analyzed such that we will never feel doubt or guilt afterwards.\n\nPart of what you might be feeling is what I feel: a dissonance between being your cat's comrade and then all of a sudden taking the borrowed human power over life and death and deciding this is where life ends. It feels like a betrayal. But gradually we learn to trust ourselves again.",

Whether it’s the beauty of a sunrise, the satisfaction of a warm meal, the snuggly feeling (perhaps in your otherwise uncomfortable) sleeping bag after an uncomfortable day, or the power of your healthy body to do hard things.\n\nIt’s hard to make ourselves *not* think about something. It’s much easier to turn our focus *toward* something. So focusing on the good is more likely to be impactful than trying to set aside thoughts of the bad. That said, if you find yourself having internal conversations about the unpleasant parts of your trip, steering away from those and cutting them short will help.\n\nThis may be a once in a lifetime chance for you (for better or worse). So what value can you take from it to make it worth it? What is special about this month? It may be the chance to test personal limits, or to stretch and let yourself push harder than you normally would. To forge a new friendship. To practice everything you’re asking about here.\n\nMake it about something that you want. You control what this month is about.",

    "text": "Summer field is the absolute best month of your life!   We did 6 weeks in the sierras and it was spectacular.  You hike and do research all day, map and draft up reports etc.  Then party every night!  Where is your field camp located?  It is a lot of hardcore field geology but also a lot of river swimming and adventuring with friends.  \n\nMy best advice is to start hiking and training now.  Get some good hiking boots and comfy hiking socks and start breaking them in.  Start gathering the gear you will need and try it out on weekend hikes so it will be familiar and comfortable for your trip.  Make sure your backpack is comfortable and has enough water capacity, get a light, packable rain jacket and some comfortable non-cotton layers, and some comfortable hiking pants.  Also a pair of hiking sandals is useful for rest days when you want to give your feet a break from your boots.  Hike on the weekends and take a fitness class or hit the gym several nights per week to prepare.  This will be very helpful with the longer hiking days, especially if you will be doing field camp at elevation.  Bring some OTC medicine but especially a bottle of ibuprofen for sore muscles and you get stronger, and Zyrtec if you have allergies.  While you are at field camp be sure to stay really hydrated, wear lots of sunscreen, and eat a lot!  You will come back beautifully tanned and in the best shape of your life!\n\nSummer field is such an amazing experience.  It is truly life changing.  At the end of my field camp I was so bummed to return to civilization.  The bonds you will form with some of your classmates will never be broken.  And whether you go into field geology or not for your career you will remember the experience for a lifetime!",

    "text": "that's what is called mind clutter. Just 20\" of focused meditation each day will help, but it takes time. To cut down on the time to get to a place of positivity, use Monroe or another binaural beat system. That will take you about 40\" of meditation, but it's easy because it's guided, for the most part.\n\nThe other thing you should do is fill your time up with productive activities that you enjoy.  Let's take a person who enjoys gardening:  they will be happy when they engage in that activity. Even if you dont' particularly enjoy the activity, just by keeping your mind busy, say with your job, you will find it easier to keep the clutter or chatter from going.\n\nThat's the whole point:  learn to cut out the chatter/clutter and you will find yourself a more secure, happier person overall.\n\n\\-------\n\non edit:  I forgot an important item!  Meditation actually changes your brain. You can read about how and how it affects positivity in a book called Spiritual Intelligence by Dawson Church.",

    "text": "Yellowstone will be fantastic.  I was already into field work and did end up going into industry as a field geologist after graduation.  However some of my friends were not as field oriented, and the professors were able to accommodate their strengths and abilities when assigning final research projects.  The way my class did it, for the first half of the trip we all did the same project and would help each other and figure it out together as a class.  For the second half of the trip we all worked on smaller individual or group projects.  One girl had ongoing knee problems so she did a project that did not have much hiking at all and was more structural geology oriented, with a lot of detailed measurements of a specific outcrop.  I think she wrote her report about the deformation of some igneous inclusions in the area, which is super cool, but not as physical.\n\nAlso many folks had partners or small groups to work on their final project.  Only a few of us crazies did solo.\n\nThey will give out a more detailed pack list so you can prepare.  The most important thing to bring is a positive attitude and an open mind.  Definitely get your fitness up, and there will be struggles and discomfort (I sliced my hand open on a broken beer bottle and had to do the rest of field camp with a big bandage on my hand.  Oops.  That probably won’t happen to you. 🙃). But overall the experience will be epic. You will learn and grow, and increase your confidence in the field and in yourself.  Not many folks get such an amazing opportunity.  Also, bring a lot of bug repellant!",

    "text": "I went through exactly the same thing 2 years ago. Over time, I have come to understand what \"dirty grief\" is -- a form of irrational guilt. This is a guilt we turn on ourselves because we feel powerless. We loved our cats, and we were responsible for their happiness and well-being. Regardless of the fact that we made the best decision possible -- to end the suffering of our beloved companions -- we continually return to the the feeling that we could have done more or something different. What a profound feeling of powerlessness this is! Not too long ago, I did a guided Hoʻoponopono meditation (reconciliation and foregiveness) and although I cried for my cat's forgiveness, I realized the entity I needed to forgive was myself. This is still a process, but yes, reflection and meditation and mindfulness do help. I didn't start doing any meditation or mindfulness reading or practicing until after I lost my cat, and it has helped me a great deal to find some peace and understanding. I hope you find the same.",

So enlightenment, or whatever your personal 'bigger purpose' in life, is what's  important. But regardless of that, you will always have to make a contribution to your community, to be able to live. In modern times that basically means having a job and contributing to the global community/economy in some way, even if its some niche/obscure way that feels meaningless.\n\nwhen it comes to feeling drained, i'd say that's either down to energy management, or being in a job that's too demanding ,or some of both. In the modern western world though there's not much awareness of energy work to maintain that side of things. For me qi gong and nei gong have made a big difference to that side of things.",

I didn't really grow up in a Church. And then I couldn't get past Church's normalization of pedophilia and now turning the word \"Christian\" into a brand that spews hate in order to gain power.  But Jesus has always been there.  His teachings patiently waiting. So I turned to the Sermon on the Mount - but I found just reading the words in Mathew 5-7 wasn't enough because Jesus was speaking to folks (Jews) 2000 years ago in a manner (parables) familiar with rabbis, but new to me. However, Jesus is the ultimate teacher..so I finally found a book that helped me understand what love means (it is very difficult to love an \"enemy\" , how I should live my life, and why serving others is important.  The book that helps me is A.J. Levine's Sermon on the Mount: A Beginner's Guide to the Kingdom of Heaven.",

Placing such constraint on to the self make it impossible to treat, something you don't want fixing in your mind{the way things are} becomes reality because you perceive it as the only way to live for the rest of your life. The mind is the first hurdle sure may need more than just mind power {medications [do only treating the after effect and not the root cause], treatments, exercises, etc...} but all start from the mind. I truly believe anything is possible with enough effort and time. Sure maybe in current era may seem like a very tall order but what about in 100 years? That's why I'm saying perception is king. \n\nThe negativity aspect from last post was on the fact that the tone of @guyabove and how he was wording his sentences. Negativity has nothing to do with the illness and all with the mindset of the individual. You can have a person lose all his limbs but his mindset will dictate the way he proceed in life if he will allow it to effect him or move on. \n\nSo in other words, I'm not saying you don't have your own battle we all do, but just that you got this 🫡\n\nTake care now.",

I had been smoking or vaping weed from the moment I awoke until the moment I slept for like 5 years. \n\nI found while high I was less able to concentrate and my mind wandered to wherever it wanted. What I thought were insights were often just mirages that seemed significant in the moment, but that turned out to just be the effect of the high. I had also started to get a bit paranoid about things as my smoking habit went on. I went to a mindfulness retreat in December and it was excellent not being high and being able to meditate and enjoy the sacred silence. \n\nFor me, my experiences with magic mushrooms were more comparable to deep meditation, depending on the dosage. Feelings of oneness, interconnectedness, universal love and epiphany. That and some beautiful visual effects.",

If you focus on that you can achieve it, but that isn't the purpose or goal.\n\nMindfulness is about experiencing things as they are, being high is about altered perception.\n\nUnfortunately, 'constant bliss' has a neurological price to pay. The brain can't produce that state without crashing. We aren't built that way. \n\nPleasure and bliss can be exhausting as goals, but serenity is a different experience.\n\nTo be okay with not being okay is a mindfulness goal, with taking right action being the purpose.\n\nYou can be serene about horror and bliss playing out in life, seeing them both as drama and traps. Both make it hard to take right action. \n\nIt isn't particularly about acceptance, but serenity. With serenity, if there is pain, horror and starvation, you clean up, provide for needs and feed someone. With bliss (imagine a heroin addict, experiencing ultimate bliss) you can do the same - clean up, provide for needs and feed someone.\n\nUltimately, people trapped in extremities of bliss or horror need someone to look at what chores need to be done, what bills need to be paid, what to eat.\n\nSerenity is an efficient brain place that doesn't burn up brain chemistry resources and confronts reality with practical action for greater good.\n\nBliss and horror are internal, subjective experiences about self and circumstance.

    "text": "I had a spiritual awakening a couple years back and got into mindfulness and meditation.  Thought I was invincible.  Only to go through a relationship with someone who was completely emotionally dysfunctional.\n\nIt was more of a slow burn, but I felt more and more of a disconnect to what is and consciousness.  Began reacting out of old patterns, so on and so forth.\n\nOne huge thing I’ve learned that I was missing is that my reactions are so engrained that before my mind could actually keep up to what was going on in my thoughts, I had already begun reacting and making the situation worse.  Especially in high pressure moments.  Such as someone yelling at you, or wielding their emotions like a weapon and blaming you for them.\n\nThere is brief moment in instance of danger where your body reacts before your mind ever does.  It’s like a warning signal.  \n\nIt is instinctual, and there’s nothing you can do about it.  But it can serve as a warning that something has been triggered.\n\nFor me, it felt like a jolt of lightning or energy that quickly runs throughout my body.\n\nBody reacts causing feeling -> Feeling triggers fight or flight in the mind -> Cognition and consciousness go off line -> Defense mechanisms take over.\n\nAgain, all of these things have occurred before consciousness can even go “Oh shit, I’m in fight or flight.”\n\nI had fully understood the negative feedback loop of unpleasant thought causes feeling -> feeling deemed unpleasant -> unpleasant judgement creates unpleasant thought -> unpleasant thought creates unpleasant feeling -> repeat ad infinitum\n\nDon’t judge the feeling, and cycle broken.  Right?\n\nSo what do you do when the cycle is already in full swing before you can even know what is going on?\n\nIt never occurred to me that the feeling comes before the thought.\n\nIt’s the body’s hardwired instinctual defense mechanism that perceives danger.  Regardless of why it’s there, regardless of what moment taught it to be triggered, it is there.\n\nIf I can catch the feeling in my body and teach myself “brakes” the moment I feel it, I can, thus, break the chain of events before it even starts.\n\nMy therapist recommended somatic meditation which has been wonderful for me both therapeutically and understanding the subconscious feelings in my body.\n\nGreat post!",

After such lifestyle for a long time , I noticed a huge cognitive decline from when I was 15 to now that I'm 25.\n\nI used to be like the smart guy in all circles and everyone praised my memory as something incredible. Now at work I can barely focus, get lost in any conversation of complicated stuff and completely forget the instructions my manager gives me. I forget almost everything I'm told and need to write down everything. Also feel super sleepy and brain foggy in general even if I sleep 8 hours.\n\nA shame but I try not to be too tough on myself. My biggest advice to youngsters, don't loose a minute of sleep and educate yourself on sleep hygiene and importance. In my case, my bad sleep habits (constant all nighters etc), stress + Aerospace engineering destroyed my sleep for many years and my brain paid for it.",

Are you getting enough protein in your diet?  At least 1 satiating meal a day? I would try doing 2, 3, plus snacks. Look at your hydration too. Consistent sleep factors in as well. Trauma can cause brain fog too. \n\nAre you moving your body at least 1x a day or a few times a week? Walks are amazing, even short ones. Your social life is another factor. \n\nDifferent timeline but I've gone through similar experiences. For me, it wasn't an overnight fix. I'd say it helps not to fight what you're experiencing/feeling rn (it's natural to want to return to your previous state, not be in a state of discomfort but at this time try not to force things too heavily ex. extensive reading. It can take time for things to shift). You want to be an observer of your experience. Replace self-blame or bashing with self-love and grace. Acknowledge this as a temporary state, not a permanent condition. \n\nI wouldn't go at everything at once, hard and fast (possible above factors). Don't overwhelm your system. Take your time. For me, it took months. \n\nYou may want to visit your doctor as well, have them do bloodwork to rule out any factors on that end. \n\nIn your shoes, I'd be very kind to myself rn (be soft and gentle). I'd try incorporating as much comfort in my life rn, and I'm talking about even your clothes. For now, ditch the constrictive, hard fabrics. I'd surround myself with supportive, loving family and friends. I'd eat my favorite foods, engage in my fav hobbies, listen to my fav tunes, surround my environment with my fav scents etc. all while acknowledging my current condition as again a temporary state. The idea is exploring ways to regulate your nervous system. \n\nI wish you well in your healing journey.",

    "text": "If you're chasing bliss - an extreme example here would be on a sliding scale from 'heroin addict' or 'toxically positive' or any flavor of this. This can reflect an obsession/addiction/mindset. Heroin addicts in that extreme will ignore food, family, etc. and only chase that bliss. It's real to them, but entirely subjective. People that are toxically positive believe that thinking bad thoughts will bring bad actions or bad repercussions. But in reality, bad things, bad thoughts, intrusive thoughts, horror in the world can be confronted and although they still have power over you (they can kill you and you will not escape death someday) they don't control thoughts or actions.\n\nPeople trapped in horror - this is psychological and physical. Those suffering intense physical and psychological pain also can ignore food, family, etc., be unable to move, feed themselves, prone to crippling depression, any number of expressions. \n\nExtremes of the spectrum can show some of the same behaviors. Someone challenged to give up a thought form or an addiction often treat it with complete and even violent rejection. \n\nImagine being schizophrenic and having hallucinations. They can buy into the delusion and devolve into accepting the relative hallucination as real and reject reality. So to take an example from the story of \"A Beautiful Mind\" where a man has schizophrenia and he chooses a \"mindfulness check\" - check with another person whether or not a new person is real. If he doesn't do that, he devolves into ego-drive fantasy and gets lost in them. \n\nThe more mindful we become, the more practical we become. We might be relatively boring to others, but we're not sources of drama. We're concerned with the real world. \"Do the people/animals/the patch of the world under my care (or just me if I'm under my own care) have enough to eat, are they warm, do they have everything they need, is my space clean and healthy, are my choices optimized for greater good?\" \n\nEveryone can do this to the best of their ability. For instance I used to have horrific migraines. I couldn't do anything - but I COULD keep it from getting worse. I couldn't stop the pain, but I could keep myself from adding to the psychological pain and suffering. I didn't ask \"Why me?!\" (although I did at first) or \"When will this end?!\" (although I did at first.) Becoming mindful of the horror meant I breathed, endured, accepted that I was in pain and had no control over it. \n\nYou can see in reality that there are many, many people obsessed with the subjective pursuit of bliss or escaping horror (or even pursuing horror). Bliss and horror are powerful things and the mind can become obsessed with them and addicted to substances and thought forms that make them feel powerful. Imagine a murderer who feels the delusion of power by ending someone else's life. It's like heroin. It's subjective and to an outside observer, insane and empty as a motive.\n\nMindfulness means there's no reason to escape, no reason to delay, and right action and right thought are the purpose. That usually means cleaning something, doing something practical, caring for someone else (or self) to the best of their capability.\n\nThat's the meaning of the Zen Proverb - “**Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water; after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water**.” Fake it 'til you make it, really. Focus on right thought and right action until it makes perfect sense to you and it's much more attractive than heroin, murder, or being important.",

    "text": "I used to daydream a lot, especially when I was feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and I always wondered if it was a bad thing. For a while, I thought it was just a way for me to escape reality, but over time, I realized that daydreaming can actually be a form of mindfulness for me. It’s not always just zoning out; sometimes, I can get lost in my thoughts in a way that helps me process emotions or come up with creative ideas. When I’m in a good headspace, I can use daydreaming as a way to reframe a situation or think through something I’m struggling with. However, when I was in a rough patch, I found that daydreaming could also pull me further away from the present moment, making me feel even more disconnected from everything around me.\n\nThe key for me has been balance. I’ve learned to be more aware of when my daydreaming is helping me recharge or when it’s just a way to avoid dealing with what’s in front of me. Now, I try to keep my mindfulness practice strong so that I can use daydreaming in a more intentional way. If I’m noticing myself slipping into negative spirals of daydreaming, I’ll gently pull myself back into the present, focusing on my breath or doing a grounding activity. So, I don’t think daydreaming is inherently bad, but it’s important to check in with yourself and make sure it’s not taking you away from what you need to be doing in the moment.",

    "text": "Not specifically four years after graduating, but I've had a very similar experience.\n\nSince finishing school I've been far less creative, less engaged with things, and intellectual stimulation seemed a burden more often than not, and not out of disinterest, but because I felt like I couldn't engage on a level I wanted to.  I've spent much time over the years reflecting on this and I believe part of it is the variety of inputs during school and the objectives with them, at least for me.\n\nThrough a regular week at university we'd be taking in a wide variety of information.  For example, actively engaged with any combination of theology, philosophy, different types of science, mathematics, history, business of various levels, art, politics, and management, and then being tested on it.  Now, working in an office, I'm on the phone, in meetings, or reviewing and writing reports and documents all specific to my one area of expertise.  On top of that, for a good while, during my free time I wouldn't want to continue engaging my brain unless necessary.  I was focused on very few things and only seriously engaging with one, work.\n\nFor the last couple years I've been listening to science, philosophy, and theology podcasts more often than music, reading, consuming less media and actually analyzing the media I do consume much more as opposed to watch, then immediately looking for what's next only to repeat.  I've also been running and meditating a lot, and while running I either have a podcast or no audio at all.\n\nI've felt much better in terms of my curiosity and mental engagement these last couple years with those changes than I did before.  I don't know what your free time looks like, but I think intentionality in active engagement as opposed to passive consumption makes a huge difference, and engagement with a variety of subjects instead of a narrow focus too.  In school our brains were flexible and reaching far in a number of drastically different directions, only to over time be funneled into a more rigid \"you do this, this is your job, this is how you do your job, get it done\" mentality.  I think we need that flexibility.",

I'm 3 years out from post-grad.\n\nAdmitting it was a big first step, but it also will bring the problem out and it's hard to put it away once you admit it.\n\nI then pushed myself to really have difficult life conversations with myself and people around me. Specifically for me, I needed to work on my health, and also stop being so hard on myself / negative thinking.\n\nIt was harder to work on this in grad school, as it was too intense. I was fortunate my first 2 jobs out of school were relatively easy going - so I did an average job at work, then mostly focused on myself. I went to the gym, I learned how to eat better, I spent time with friends / put myself out there looking for a gf.\n\nIt wasn't one specific thing, but the accumulation of taking it easier on myself and gaining some confidence and time away from hardcore problem solving eventually started to lift my burnout. I had to really (still working on it) accept myself for all my faults and strengths. Worked very hard to stop comparing myself to others or even artificial standards I created. Moving out helped a lot too (great parents, but they are very negative people)\n\nI'll also throw in.. I'm guilty too but getting off NEGATIVE REDDIT and social media that makes you feel rage/upset/doom/etc is going to clear your head really good too. Even if you just replace it with playing video games and TV it's much better for your mental health.\n\nWhat helped me really pull out was last year I entered a tough crunch at my job, it was 4 months of working 40+ hrs and getting bad performance reviews despite trying my absolute best while dealing with health issues. I looked my challenges in the eye and said if I'm going to get laid off, I'm going to go out on my terms by trying my 100% without over-exertion.\n\nI accomplished my goal, and it felt like my burnout was lifting after that. I started to actually look forward to putting in an honest effort at work everyday after that.\n\nUnfortunately, my journey then led to a layoff that was out of my control - so now my burnout has been battle hardened tested with the cruelty that is this current tech job market. I have failed 9 technical rounds in 3.5 months, and I have 3 more technical rounds scheduled this next week in a seemingly never ending gauntlet (still GRATEFUL im getting these chances)\n\nDespite all odds and the fear of financial insecurity and struggling heavily against learning how to master interviews - I have a sense of pride and respect for me just trying my absolute best, even if I'm depressed about being laid off. Accepting your best may not be as good as you want it to be is by far one of the hardest things I'm struggling to work on in my endless journey of self-improvement.",

Going deeply into my own feelings has given me the freedom and comfort to be a lot more open and vulnerable with other people. \n\nAs for how to sit with your emotions, I’m not sure that it’s always going to be particularly comfortable! For me it was distinctly uncomfortable for quite a while. But at some point I came to the realisation that the only reasonable thing to do was to process all of my own feelings, and that it was worth going through the discomfort to do that. What you might find helpful, from a practical perspective, is to view feelings as sensations - after all, this is really what they are. We experience some sort of physical sensation, and we attach a story to that sensation and package it up with a name. For example, “I feel shame because of this thing that I did” is really a combination of a bodily sensation and a mental story about something that happened. If we break it down in this way it’s easier to see that there’s not really anything to be afraid of there - we might find the sensation uncomfortable, but we can certainly choose to feel it if we see enough value in doing so.",

So if you wish the experience to gradually move towards more equanimity, you need to work with the aversion to being uncomfortable.\n\nYou could try things like relaxing the body, sending loving kindness to yourself or to the emotion, holding the discomfort gently within awareness and allowing it moment to moment, dissect the \"I\" that is supposedly feeling it, among many other options.\n\nA very important aspect from a practical standpoint is learning how to work with attention in a non-tight way and know when to back off from applying \"techniques\" and just relax for a while if it starts feeling like you're trying to meditate the emotion away through concentration.\n\nAlso, it won't always work. Especially if you're just starting.

And most of the time, even if I feel like I should say something, I won't unless I feel very clear that I have no attachment to the outcome of doing so or that I am willing to accept and fight whatever fight I stir up.\n\n* I have no idea how common my own experience is, but at this time in my life all social interactions for me boil down to learning experiences.

And that require no back and forth or acknowledgement. \n\n* I don't know anything. I am no one. The best I can possibly hope for is that I inadvertently say something that actually proves to be helpful to someone in a real and meaningful way. The satisfaction I get from that possibility is the best thing I get out of Reddit. \n\n* All I can do is be as clear and honest with myself about my intentions for whatever I put out there. I know that the more driven I am by my ego, the more vulnerable and fragile I am about the kind of responses I get. \n\nTo my mind:\n\n* If you have expectations of what kind of results you're going to get, you might be in trouble. The degree to which you are in trouble depends on how much of your happiness or self worth are invested in getting the kind of results you expect. \n\n* If you feel good and you hold your hand out so that whoever is receptive to it can benefit from it, without being tied to how people receive it or if they receive it at all, and you can be happy purely for the possibility that somebody could feel lighter in the world for you having put your hand out, then you are good to go. \n\n* If you are not already on good footing in terms of not taking things personally and maintaining equanimity, then you are essentially performing an experiment with your well being interacting with people online to see if you can connect, ask questions, or provide feedback. And that's perfectly fine to do, but the less intentional you are about it the more of a rough ride you are going to have. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

I will admit, I had to stop thinking so much and just focus on exercise and being in the moment. I have to turn off my music more often but I use music because I have a rare migraine which makes it hard to be a more mindful person. So, physical pain is chronic and constant for me. If I were to be mindful, I might realize that the writing is there for me only if the chronic migraine pain helps me write better. My characters are in pain but they thrive. I'm mindful of that. I will share this: By shutting down my fears, I think utilizing FOCUS during exercise to garner endorphin pain killers is what mindfulness helped me realize was most imporant for now. Perhaps, a stronger body might make me write more and more when I'm ready. I still write but it's just ideas on the side. Powerful ideas.",

Even if you remove the unknowns that AI introduces, there's one thing AI just can't do at the moment that humans can, which is to pursue two lines of conversation. Eg it might ask short questions to try and understand, at a surface level, what you are dealing with, but it is incapable of also staying aware of the big picture while it does that. Even when you ask it to sum up what you've discussed, all it ever gives you is a collection of individual shallow points. It pads them out and tarts them up to appear like a big picture observation, but it never comes up with an out-of-box observation that a human being might, which throws you but is exactly what you need all the same. \n\nUntil it shows it's capable of doing that, I see ai as being very limited in what it can achieve.",

    "text": "This is the all-too-often overlooked aspect of mindfulness. Meditation is great but it's like having a safe haven to return to, in between facing the adversity of the real world. Why can't we take that safe haven with us when we go out into the world?\n\nIt takes a lot more time (in meditation) to unravel the stresses of a day if you haven't been acting mindfully all day than if you have. \n\nI like to use a technique I call 'full and complete'. It just means if I'm going to do something, I will do it fully and completely. I first noticed how nicely it fit together when I was taking my washing off the clothes line. Normally my mind would be somewhere else as I reached for each clothes peg, removed it, then removed the item of clothing and put it in the washing basket. But I decided to fully and completely experience each task.\n\nFirst, slide my hand through the item of clothing until I found where the direct surface of the peg was.\n\nSecond, feel the surface of the peg, and locate the point where it needs to be squeezed in order to open.\n\nThird, place a force on the peg and feel the spring counter the squeezing of my fingers. Notice if there is any change in the movement of the peg along the way as it opens.\n\nFourth, remove the peg and feel the item of clothing fall away from the clothes line.....\n\n(you get the idea). \n\n  \nThe other thing that helps me is to recognise that living this way actually isn't about doing 'more' of anything, but it's about doing 'less'. It's easy to think \"i'm going to 'do more mindfulness'\" but really, what you're doing is LESS of the stuff that takes you away from presence.\n\nPresence is our default state. We just think our way out of it by constantly ruminating over something else that we need to be doing.",

It’s all about slowing down and being fully present, even in tasks that usually feel mundane. I can totally relate to how easy it is for the mind to wander while doing something like hanging laundry—taking the time to really feel and experience each step makes such a difference in staying grounded.\n\nAnd yes, I think you're spot on with the idea that mindfulness isn't about doing more, but doing *less* of those distractions. It’s really about cutting out the unnecessary noise so we can just *be*. Taking those moments to center ourselves in the present, even when life is busy, is such a game-changer. 🌟\n\nThanks for sharing this! I’m definitely going to try applying the “full and complete” approach to more of my daily tasks. 😊",

To overcome thoughts, one has to constantly develop awareness, as this will watch over thoughts so that they hardly arise. Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements. Whenever you realize you've lost awareness, simply return to it. do it continuously and awareness will grow stronger and stronger, it will intercept thoughts and make them shorter and fewer. the mind will return to its natural state, which is clean, bright and peaceful..

Depending on your age and dependency on your parents, something to consider.\n\nI basically did that, somewhat subconsciously, by moving to another state when I was 37. My brother (2 years older) and sister (12 years older), who were(are?) still dealing with their stuff, stopped answering my emails pretty quickly, so I stopped sending them. After 20 years, I somewhat reconnected with my brother, but not my sister, and I am OK with it.\n\nI continued to talk separately with my parents, who divorced after all three kids were grown, but we were never close. They are both deceased now, and although I have let go of most of the anger, I don't miss them.\n\nBottom line is do what you need to do for yourself. Your parents, etc. need to fix their own problems.\n\nI practice mindfulness, especially quieting my mind. I don't have any meaningful relationships, but at least that means no toxic relationships either.\n\nMaybe some other comments, or online resources, etc. can help you in separating yourself from toxic relationships.",

    "text": "Is upsc an exam? I'm inferring that you're trying to study hard for another month and a half?\n\nYou cannot fight your mind. The key is to learn coping strategies that help you work with the mind that you have. Finding what works for you can be a journey.\n\nI'm sure you do have the potential you think you have - you know yourself best. Anxiety, ADHD, and stress are all conditions for which relief exists. But it can be a journey to find the relief that is best for you.\n\nWhat do you know about yourself already? Sitting persistently sounds like torture for someone with ADHD, so what works better for you? Frequent breaks? Physical movement? Changing tasks often? Talking aloud while you learn? Making it a game?\n\nWhat are your best tricks that you already have for managing stress? Start doing those things - the time they take will help you focus. I mean this. Take breaks to do the things that help manage your stress.\n\nTake this advice from someone who learns for a living and also has ADHD. I spent decades suffering from stress and burnout until I finally solved that problem (that took me a few years of therapy and a dozen self-help books, so I can't recommend a 40d solution, but these are the key points). You can be high-performing and live a good, stress-free life, and you can do a lot of remediate anxiety. But it requires addressing those problems head-on by seeking solutions that work, rather than trying to push through. The unfortunate part of this reply is that we do this work best when we *aren't* stressed, so that the strategies and coping mechanisms will be in our repertoire when we need them.\n\nFor now, take a break and do some exercise/stretching/breathing/singing/whatever to lower your stress level. Good luck with the challenge you've set for yourself.",

Thoughts are like guests visiting the mind from time to time. They come and go. To overcome thoughts, one has to constantly develop awareness, as this will watch over thoughts so that they hardly arise. Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements. Whenever you realize you've lost awareness, simply return to it. do it continuously and awareness will grow stronger and stronger, it will intercept thoughts and make them shorter and fewer. the mind will return to its natural state, which is clean, bright and peaceful. .

Three suggestions:\n\nWhat moved this needle for me was leadership training. Learning how and why companies progress people helped me understand the importance of leaning into the job that I *have* and not the job that I *want,* which perhaps paradoxically, gets you the job that you want faster. The Leadership Pipeline is short and to the point and provided much-needed perspective.\n\nUnderstanding my relative value on the job market (by applying for other roles) helped me understand my relative worth. Also great for building your network and your perspective as you ask for feedback on your goals and resume. The insight you’ll gain about when you can walk away, when you can jump, and when you should be grateful for what you have might be enlightening.\n\nExamine your core values: what you want from your job, what you want from your life, what’s important to you minute-to-minute and day-to-day. This’ll help recalibrate your perspective on your role, how you spend your time, and your ambition. In case it’s not obvious, this is the mindfulness part. It can take some time to get to know yourself well enough to really solidly answer these questions.",

    "text": "By Knowing the truth, you set yourself free. \nWhat's the truth? That society is not a fixed entity. It's ever changing. The beliefs and ideologies dictating a society keeps changing over years. So the question comes: why obey and live one's life according to these ever changing things? Competition is man-made construct. Career ladder, another construct. It boxes you in a suffocating existence, where you're never content with your output, because there's always someone better and always somewhere to reach (trajectory, job switch). Empty your mind of all this nonsense for 10 minutes and you'll see how illusory it all is. \n\n\nYou get a job. Earn money to fund your survival and existence. You have fun contributing your skills and talents too. Keep it simple. \n\n\nSimplicity will liberate you from these exhausting constructs of the corporate world. At the end of your life, all that will matter is how much you enjoyed your life. Professional achievements, other ppl's judgements, that corporate ladder, nothing will matter. You're a human, not a robot. \n\n\nThe corporate world runs on \"live to work\", brainwashing vulnerable ppl to think a career is their life. Reality is we should \"work to live\", only focusing on what it gives us and keeping it at that. It's a part of your life, it's not your whole life.\n\n\nWhat I said here is a tiny portion of the wisdom from Buddhist teachings. I encourage you to study Zen Buddhism and the lifestyle they encourage us to live. \nThat life automatically reduces stress, as you learn how to live in accordance with your well being and peace. \nRead books by Haemin Sunim. They're available free online in pdf form. They contain various Zen teachings for the modern world. Please live according to these teachings. You'll benefit tremendously.",

Whether it's remembered by God, by our peers, or only by ourselves. \n\n\nBut when we put our energy towards good deeds, selfless acts, in pursuit of a legacy of..goodness.. (for lack of a better word): are we truly doing it for others, or to make ourselves feel better? Is it because we have good intentions, or we're padding our 'application' to reach the heavens?\n\n\nEither way, intention and action are separate. The only way they can be blended is if you do kindness with a smug attitude, a chip on your shoulder, or with the judgement that others are all of a sudden less than you.\n\n\nPeople need help. Everyone does. Keep helping others when you are able, and ask for help when you are in need. As long as you are humble you will be remembered for the right reasons.\n\n\nThank you for doing your part",

    "text": "I've been in a similar situation where I was told to meet goals for two employees single-handedly for 3 years. Yes, you're right - it was definitely very stressful. \n\nHowever, I got to a point where I didn't overly worry about it, since I did all I could to try to meet the goals. I also found out that other projects (it was a government funded program) weren't meeting the goals, either. \n\nNumber one, you need to document all that you're doing, and meet regularly with your manager. You should email your report on a monthly basis of what you're doing to try to meet the goals, and why it didn't work out. Ask for suggestions (in writing).\n\nForward any of these emails to your private email, especially any responses that you get from the boss. What you're doing is making a paper trail for yourself in case you should get fired. You could use this as evidence when you're interviewing for another job that you did attempt to meet the goals and you did communicate with your boss regularly. Or if you have to apply for unemployment. \n\nI think that you will feel more calm knowing that you are taking actions into your own hands, regardless of what happens.\n\nSecondly, you should talk to other people in the field to see if there are other things you can do. Have you looked at r/recruiting, or r/recruiting hell subs for suggestions? Try posting there.\n\nThirdly, you need to prepare yourself to pivot to some different other field or job, in case they do fire you. This may mean more training, like a certificate or something. You can check out massive open online courses for free certificate programs.\n\nI'm not sure why they would fire you for not meeting goals, since if you can't meet them due to structural factors out of your control, then how will someone else that they hire meet these goals? The exact same structural issues are going to be present for that new person. \n\nStill, jobs are not always fair or sensible. A lot of stupid people are in charge sometimes.\n\nI think if you did these things that I'm suggesting, then you could get to a place of more serenity. Mindfulness on its own doesn't always take away stressful situations. However, if you make some changes you might be able to use mindfulness to help you feel less scared and worried.",

    "text": "That makes sense mate, and I see you got some other replies (that I haven’t read), so hopefully you’ve picked up some tips there.\n\nThe reason I asked that question was to get to the root of why you overwork, and it sounds like you have a good grasp of it. \n\nIt’s completely possible to be mindful and still be career orientated. Sometimes people mistake mindfulness as being passive, but it’s more about not holding on to things too tightly. \n\nThings I think you can reflect on:\n\nRecognise the endless ladder trap - which is sort of where you’re at. There’s always more to have and always someone better. No matter how fast or how hard we work, we cannot have or try everything in life. Reflect on what you really want and how you want to feel on a regular basis. Aim for that and don’t worry about the rest.\n\n\nSmelling the roses - if you don’t learn to pause and feel whole now, you won’t then either. The ladder has no top, so the only real arrival is learning to stand still and breathe, right where you are.\n\nOutcome thinking vs Process thinking - right now it sounds like your mind is constantly rehearsing future scenarios, and that’s exhausting.\n\nProcess thinking is focusing on how you are living life, rather than what you expect to gain from it. You stop measuring life by external markers like titles and raises, and start enjoying ‘the craft’. This often takes that pressure off you were talking about, the paradoxical situation.\n\nRedefine success in your own terms - \n\nYou’ve been working to validate yourself, accept yourself for who you are, and think about what you want from life as a validated person. The stoics have an interesting idea about how we have 2 values, one as worker, which comes with all sorts of social pressure to move up a theoretical hierarchy, and one as a soul, where we are all equal. \n\nLetting go - this might be in the other comments as it’s standard mindfulness. Practising meditation regularly has proven impacts on brain structure, most relevantly is the amygdala, which controls our reactivity to events and thoughts. The more you practise, the more you’ll be able to let go of negative thoughts.\n\nTldr: \n\nShift focus from outcome to process\n\nDefine success beyond validation\n\nPractise smelling the roses\n\nPractise letting go of negative thoughts and the demands of what is essentially your ego.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, otherwise Godspeed.",

As far as the \"making it stop\", I actually went through the same sort of thing, and found that being compassionate with yourself and keeping busy doing something you love is best. If the thought arises, which it will, don't get mad at yourself. Neural pathways get stronger the more you think of them, so the thoughts of your trauma is just strong in your brain. But these pathways can be broken, mainly by distraction. Pick up a hobby that you don't feel pressured to do, like, \"oh i HAVE to paint today\" (or something), just find something new that makes you happy. This might sound cliche, but I actually forgot about something traumatic that happened to me until I found my old diary and read an entry about it :p it gets easier with time for sure.",

So the technique involves tuning into the tensions and releasing them, as physical release is generally more easy/possible then releasing a thought.\n\nWith intense memories the tricky part can be 'getting outside the moment' to tune into the body tensions enough to release them. Over time it gets easier though. Also if you do a general 'untargeted' body scan regularly, then you can release a whole range of stuff, and some of those stronger bits get released too, as part of the general scan.\n\nIf you want to try it/know more, there are details on it here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei\\_gong\\_from\\_a\\_more\\_mentalemotional\\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei_gong_from_a_more_mentalemotional_healing/)",

Making the choice of when to alleviate their suffering when it was their time was really challenging. I definitely recommend journaling if that's helpful to you, and practicing self-compassion has been really soothing and nurturing to me. Every time something comes up that feels like guilt or sadness, I put my hand on my heart and say compassionate things - \"This is hard and it makes sense that I feel this way\" or \"I'm so sorry we're struggling right now. This feeling will pass.\" Being able to show up for myself with kindness has changed the way I talk to myself and provide myself with a lot of support.",

My dad poked fun and said, \"You're turning really red,\" which made it worse. I couldn't help but grin even more. (I just gave the tongs back so the woman behind the desk could get a fresh pair. I even made the cashier smile).\n\nEither you laugh in the moment and make a good memory out of it, or you say, \"Oh well,\" happens to the best of us. It's not a big deal. We're only human.

    "text": "Hi! It's an excellent question!\n\nIf you give your attention to the breath (or whatever your chosen object of meditation is) do you lose peripheral awareness? No, of course not. Your entire experience remains in peripheral awareness at all times. If it was truly an all-or-nothing thing then you would have no awareness of anything other than the breath. If your house burned down you would be a goner!\n\nWhen we start to meditate, our control over our attention is generally very weak. We have probably let it run on autopilot for our entire life! For this reason, the first instruction that is generally given in meditation is to gain some control over our attention. We can forget about peripheral awareness for the time being and focus only on attention. \n\nOnce we have gained a certain amount of control over our attention, it no longer requires 100% of our mental effort to remain aware of the breath. With whatever inner space we have left over, we can start to simultaneously be aware of the entirety of our experience while not forgetting the breath. Meditation at this stage becomes a matter of learning to balance attention and awareness. Rather than narrowing our focus to attend only to the breath, we intend to expand our awareness to include the sum total of our experience, while also remaining aware of our meditation object. \n\nIf this seems to be impossible, then you can work on either attention or awareness independently. Taking the perspective of awareness is probably the closer of these two things to \"mindfulness\" as it's generally understood in Western culture. This is the \"zooming out\" (so to speak) to the point of view of *being aware of being aware*, or \"being the witness.\" \n\nI think the attention side of the coin is probably easier for people to get a feel for initially, because you get some really solid feedback that you're doing it. If I say \"give your attention to the sensation of your big toe\" you know that you're doing it. There is no doubt about it. If I say \"be the witness\" or \"become aware of being aware\" or \"take the position of awareness,\" what do you do? It is very difficult for most people to grasp because they are used to perceiving themself as the *one who meditates*. But whether this is true or not, it isn't the point of view of awareness - the meditator is also an object of perception! To truly take the perspective of awareness we have to see all perception (at least initially - chill out non-dualists) as separate from us. This means that the body, the mind, all feelings and all sense perceptions are seen as objects of perception, and we remain as the subject who perceives all this. From this perspective it is possible to maintain peripheral awareness while also including your chosen object of meditation.",

    "text": "I had a similar brain fog feeling as you, actually it was more like postnatal anxiety. But, I got really obsessed with my diet, and went almost full carnivore for a few weeks. And then literally, I felt like the fog had lifted off my head. Am I carnivore now 4 years later? NO. But, do I have a more meat absed diet? yes. So, if you are desperate, do an experiment. Try eating only or mostly meat and meat based products for say 30 days, and then see how you feel. You might even start feeling better after 1 week! If that is too extreme, you can start by cutting out all grains. But actually, for me, the first thing I did was eat KFC, and even though its greasy seed oil food, it felt so good to be eating mostly meat, because I had been eating a lot of rice and bread and reading these \"healthy\" cooking magazines, which were mostly vegetarian recipes, and for me that didn't work. My body prefers having more meat, beef, etc, and even today I realised I can't eat rice anymore, because after eating rice for lunch, I was SO CRABBY. \n\n  \nSo tldr, my advice is look at your diet and make some drastic changes as an experiment and see how it goes.",

    "text": "Based on my experience with pure awareness, I want to say this gently and truthfully: nothing is wrong with you, and nothing is missing from you. What you are seeking outside—in the form of attention, validation, or comparison—is already whole within you. Pure awareness doesn’t compare one flower to another; it simply shines through both. What you’re feeling is very human, but your true worth has never depended on who messages you or who notices you. It’s beyond form, beyond face, beyond the external world that constantly changes. Your presence, your essence, is infinite intelligence expressing itself as *you*. No copy exists. You are not less—you are simply unique, and your energy moves in its own way, at its own time.\n\nSometimes, people who draw more attention are simply playing out a different pattern, often one that matches a certain frequency—whether it’s attraction, openness, or a certain vibe others pick up on. That doesn’t make them better or worse. Your quieter path may actually be preserving your energy for deeper, more meaningful connections. In this life, we all unfold exactly as we are meant to. Don’t be discouraged by timing or appearances—life isn’t overlooking you. It’s preparing you. Stay grounded in who you *truly* are, not what the world tells you to be. There’s a beauty in your silence, a wisdom in your wondering, and a time coming that will feel perfectly aligned. Let life unfold from within you, not from the outside in. You’re not behind—you’re right on time.",

    "text": "“Awareness” is literally what you are. Thoughts take place within your awareness... within YOU. *So does everything else you have ever experienced, or ever will experience.* It may be helpful to view thought as your sixth sense, the sense that gives you a “sense of self.” The ego is quite literally a story generated by thoughts you habitually identify with, and has no existence outside of them, which is why it tends to fight so hard against putting your attention on anything but thoughts. One thought leads to another, leads to another, and so on. The ego is formed and reinforced by these repetitive, habitual chains of thought. Pull your awareness away from your thoughts and put it on your breathing. Then put it on how your right foot feels. Then put it on the color of the wall in your immediate environment. If you do this with enough focus, you will come upon a startling, albeit disorienting revelation: *Thought is not necessary for awareness, just as touch or hearing are not necessary for awareness*. However, compulsively paying attention exclusively to your thoughts for an extended period of time is the norm in our world, and lends those thoughts a kind of self-sustaining momentum, and if the compulsion is bad enough that you identify almost entirely as your thought-stream, various mental illnesses involving detachment from reality can result.\n\nYou may find it difficult, if not impossible, to notice how your right foot feels without automatically having a thought about that sensation judging it as good or bad, then having your awareness hone in exclusively on that thought-judgment, and then having your awareness rapidly identify with that thought-judgment as “all of you.” *It tends to feel like if you pull attention away from thinking, you will die. I am not hyperbolizing here; most of the atrocities we see in the world are done because someone's ego is trying to keep the thought-stream alive so consistently and so hard that they come to believe some truly astounding things, all so their ego doesn't have to face the truth of its non-existence.*\n\nBut you aren't the thought. You're the undefinable, eternal thing/no-thing that *notices* and subsequently (mistakenly) *identifies* as that thought. Noticing this truth, and then practicing maintaining progressively more open states of awareness that encompass more and more of your total experience in any given moment, until finally awareness is aware of itself as awareness, is the core essence of meditation, and it can be the hardest skill in the world to truly master.\n\nHere's where a lot of the gurus mess up in explaining this: You can think and be expansively aware of everything else you're experiencing at the same time. *The trick is to not get so identified with the thoughts that your awareness forgets you are infinitely more than just some fleeting thoughts and begins judging reality solely filtered through those thoughts.* Thoughts on their own are neutral. Judgments are a kind of thought that are compounded with another thought to label the first as “good” or “bad.” Thoughts, like any of your other sense-streams, are there to help you move through your environment. They are living and breathing and moving and flowing, at all times. What gives them life and reality is if you are identified with them in the moment. The second you pull awareness completely away from them, they cease to exist for you, just like any other sense. How many times have you been so engrossed in something you were watching that you didn't notice you were stiff and sore until later?\n\nIf you put more awareness into a sense, the amount of data you get from that sense increases, and so does the quality of your subsequent actions. This includes thought. It is possible to become aware enough of your thoughts that their general quality increases, which will then influence the quality of your subsequent thoughts and the eventual action that arises from those thoughts (such as when you use thought to study for a test). It is also possible to REMOVE awareness from a sense, such as pulling your attention away from your sense of touch to avoid a sensation of pain. Be VERY careful with that one, though, as it's only a temporary coping mechanism in response to trauma and your body still processes the sensation… and if you continue to avoid feeling something fully, your body and mind may begin to fight against your dissociation by any means necessary to bring awareness back into the sense that needs it.\n\nThe important thing to remember is this: what you are is the eternal and infinite spacious awareness all those thoughts occur within. Realizing this down to your absolute core is enlightenment.",

    "text": "There are thought constructs about things, and there is the experience of things.\n\nThe attention can be on one or the other.\n\nIf the attention is on thought constructs, then more thoughts will tend to appear, meaning thoughts will proliferate, and can turn into a kind of daydream related to this in some way. It could be related to something in the future or past, for example, such as anticipating a future event, or thinking about it in order to prepare for it, or it could be reliving the past, or imagining different possible outcomes of past events. It could be other things too. Preparing for the future is a normal thing to do, and that may include mentally anticipating and practicing things, though it can become something that one may do excessively as a kind habitual daydream. Reflecting on the past is also a normal thing to do, though it can also become a habit pattern that one can end up doing excessively.\n\nIf you turn the attention to the experience of something, rather than the thoughts about it, then you are practicing mindfulness, and you might find that the momentum of thought streams tends to naturally decrease when you do that, revealing a kind of presence of experience (aka a presence of awareness).\n\nIt can be done with literally anything that is present in the senses and mind in the moment. Whatever is in the field of awareness, in other words. You turn the attention to the experience of it rather than the thoughts about it, doing this without trying to shut out the thoughts or alter them, just not having them as the object of attention, and experience takes that place. It can be the experience of something particular or it can be whatever is important or noticeable in the moment. It can stay on the experience of one thing until it passes or it can be more of a flowing attention, allowing it to go wherever it naturally goes. It can also be a more open attention to the experience of the field of awareness in general. It can switch between these as appropriate. You can even experience thoughts and feelings rather than paying attention to them as objects of meaning.\n\nYou can also, if you wish to, pay attention to the experience of self, rather than the thoughts about it.\n\nYou can do any of these for a while as a kind of experiment, noticing what the results are and if it helps.",

There is no perfect routine. There is no one that way to do literally anything! And I stopped beating myself up about my flow of consistency.\n\nI just started paying attention to the littlest things that feel really good for me & I started doing those more :) Like I meditate for 10 minutes in the morning, I set intentions for the day, every once in a while I will check in and segment intend ( a la Abraham Hicks), I’ll journal etc. \n\nAnd then there’s stuff that I consider spiritual that’s decidedly more  “regular” - like I started birdwatching, INCREDIBLY fun, I always feel this remarkable connection with being / freedom / the divine. \n\nWhat’s really intriguing to me, is that I’m the least hard on myself that I’ve ever been, every day is a little bit different, and yet I feel the most momentum I ever have around feeling grounded in my sense of spirituality and overall clarity and ease.",

It will fluctuate and we will unavoidably slip sometimes, but what's possible through this cultivation is probably way beyond our conception when we start practicing. Don't underestimate the power of it!\n\nAs for how to cultivate it, keep fueling that burning desire for more awareness, more sensitivity in your life. Build little routines around it, do small mindfulness challenges throughout the day, consume spiritual content and hang around people that display these inner skills as a source of motivation as their calmness and presence can also kind of rub off on you.\n\nEspecially don't judge yourself whenever the body engages in things that don't exactly help awareness. It's just an innocent machine doing what it's been programmed to do over thousands of repetitions. It will take more time and repetition before these old habits wane, so be patient.",

With the buddha's approach you'll be practicing less insight, but when you do, the mind is so sharp and equanimous that the insight will be easy to see and plunge deep into the being.\n\nOf course you can't redirect attention to the wholesome if there's no mindfulness of the unwholesome, but different traditions fork in different directions once suffering is noticed.",

They 'burn up' a lot of the neurotransmitters we need, but over time they become super refined for that task and energy use becomes extremely minimal. If not even conservative compared to any other activity. \n\nI'm not an advocate for trying to feel bliss all the time, but a middle ground between that and basically doing nothing to our experience might be found.

    "text": "Not silly at all—it's actually a great question. Mindfulness isn’t just for managing stress or negativity; it’s also about staying grounded when things feel good.\n\nWhen you're excited about the future, mindfulness helps you appreciate that excitement without getting swept away by it. You can try noticing what that excitement feels like in your body, naming the emotion (\"I’m feeling hopeful\" or \"energized\"), and gently bringing your focus back to the present. It's not about pushing the feelings away, just making space for them while still being here now.\n\nYou can also remind yourself that joy isn’t only in the outcome—it’s in the journey, too. By savoring the excitement without clinging to the outcome, you give yourself more room to feel content regardless of what happens.",

Just my opinion but your mind is in this twilight mode, not asleep, not awake - and when you think of something that you 'have to do' it's like blowing softly on embers of a fire just enough to make them glow, but not catch fire. I found that you have to commit either way. Get up and do something so you become wide awake. Or double down on focusing on your breath to get back to sleep. Good luck!",

Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements.

I don't want to bliss out and miss the experience of the unhyped moment. \n\nI choose serenity instead of bliss. No, I cannot control what is going on in the world, but I can be a sober witness and I can influence whether I choose to stay connected to the greater, wider world, live in it and experience it. \n\nHere I would imagine a citizen who blisses out in a separate space, doesn't vote, doesn't engage because subjective inner bliss consumes them. That applies to meditation as well as heroin. \n\nBliss is cutting off negative realities. That being the case, to me it is unreal. I might need or want the unreal at times, but living there is in my opinion unwise.\n\nI choose to be serene with beauty or horror and be an active participant. My goal is to do and think the next right thing, whatever that is. \n\nI could simply accept entropy and starve to blissful death, deny horror and live in subjective bliss, or I can make my practice something more akin to keeping a boat afloat. Don't stand up, jump up or down, lean too far over to see a shark or a dolphin. The choice is - row or rest.\n\nWhen I rest I can choose bliss when it aids rest. When I row I can touch bliss in the choices I've made.\n\nMostly, the world moves on with more horror and bliss and mundane repetition of boredom and miracle.\n\nI don't accept the teaching that bliss is the goal.

    "text": "Hey coming back to you 12 days later because I'm reading a book about mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MCBT) and in this book they propose a meditation called \"mindfulness of hearing and thinking\" to exercise just what you're asking - relating to thoughts with more distance, like the mental events that come and go that they are.\n\nWhat you'd do is, first, to focus for 10 minutes on your breath, then focus for another 10 minutes on the physical sensations in your entire body. This is a preparatory phase to settle and calm the mind. Then you can begin with the real \"meditation of sound\", which should teach you to relate with more distance to your thoughts. Here you should move your focus to the sounds around you, in front of you, behind you, on your sides, close to you or distant. Focus on your entire sound space.  When you get distracted, bring back your attention to the sounds and their bare sensory qualities.\n\nWhen you feel ready, move your attention away from sounds to your thoughts. Try to discern any and all thoughts that rise in your awareness just as you were noticing sounds before. Notice how the thoughts arise in your awareness and eventually dissipate.\n\nSounds are to the ear as thoughts are to the mind. Or as clouds are to the sky.\n\nAnd remember to always approach your current experience with openness and curiosity.\n\nIf you get carried away by your thoughts, you can always go back focusing on your breath and try again later to focus on your thoughts.\n\nI'm going to try this meditation myself. Hopefully it will give some results in a few weeks time...\n\nThe book recommends, at first, to focus on your thoughts for no more than 5 minutes.",

    "text": "You can make the experience of the anger the object of meditation, doing this for a while and seeing if it helps. You observe/feel the experience of it and just notice as it changes over time due to its conditions, and eventually passes. You can use the experience of breathing as a primary object that you can use when needed, and switch between the breathing and the feeling (in this case the anger) such as doing a couple of minutes on the breathing and then some time on the anger, then if needed, back to the breathing. Don't dwell on the trigger of the anger, watch the experience of the anger directly as it changes and eventually passes, keep gently turning the attention back to the experience when you find thoughts start to proliferate about it. Don't try to stop the thoughts, just don't make them the center of attention, at least while practicing this, and gently make experience the center of attention instead.\n\nYou can also, as a separate practice, reflect on the things that influenced the trigger of your anger, like what most likely came before that to make something happen a certain way or to make a person act a certain way, and then, what most likely came before that, and so on. In this way, it becomes clearer that it is less of a personal thing and more like chains of causes and effects. At some point doing this, the anger will lose its basis and will naturally dissolve.\n\nAnger is also often like a hard protective shell that has hurt at the center of it. So if the anger does dissolve, you might need to do the same thing with the hurt as for the anger, and of course it could take a number of sessions for it to dissolve, and may take months or years for it to subside naturally and completely, maybe even never, but you will be more likely not to take it as personally and less likely to react based on it if you can do something like skillfully be with the experience of it without getting stuck on thoughts about it. You can still reduce the chances of being hurt like that again by avoiding or mitigating the things/people/situations that caused it in the first place, but it is better having hurt then anger as anger often spills over into situations unrelated to the ones that caused it, and creates more problems as a result.",

When he believed a person had caused the accident, he was furious. But once he realized it was just a random act, he was no longer angry. If we recognize all behaviour as the random actions of 'empty boats,' as it were, we're less prone to anger. Or at least we're less prone to dwell on how we've been wronged by another person and thereby draw the experience of anger out for a much longer period of time.",

Why not just sit to meditate, and instead of trying to do anything, just absorb everything around you. Don’t focus on any one thing, but allow everything to move through you. Acknowledge everything for what it is when it comes, and allow yourself to let it go.\n\nFor example, if a car honks, acknowledge what it is and what your initial reactions are to it, then let the thought of it go and enjoy the symphony of everything. When you feel annoyed that your attempts to focus, or let things go, notice those feelings, then let them go. When your ideas of what meditation should be, and how it’s supposed to be done arise, allow it to be, then let it go. \n\nStop trying to do anything at all. The very definition of trying is not doing. Remove the word “trying” from your vocabulary. It is a powerful word that holds us back. Instead of, “I’m trying to meditate correctly,” you could say, “i am meditating,” and allow it to be what it is instead of trying to make it be what you so foolishly expect it to be.",

If we can count the breaths to 10 a bunch of times then we know concentration is fine even if there might be thoughts in the background, so we let the meditation gain momentum. If we're constantly losing the count however, it means that maybe reinforcing the intention to pay attention is needed since we're not fully there.\n\nAs for how to deal with freezing up, it's cliche but this works with practice: we freeze up because we build these monumental tasks in our minds that don't really exist. We can only ever do one little tiny action in the present, so maybe align your thoughts with this reality and even your \"big\" projects will become lighter endeavors.\n\nYour mind will slip back into old views, but you just keep gently introducing the new way of thinking every day and eventually it will make a big difference.\n\nGood luck.",

If 30 minutes is too long, try for 5 minutes, working up to 8 after several weeks of 5. How to meditate for 5 minutes? Find a place to sit comfortably and quietly. Light a candle, set a timer for 5 minutes. Stare at the candle. Blow it out. Get on with your day. Or walk slowly for 15 minutes. Imagine you are walking with an elderly friend or relative- that kind of pace. Just walk. Or make a cup of tea or coffee and hold the warm cup in your hands while looking at the window. Sip your beverage quietly and peacefully without interruptions. Try to do these things daily at the same time. If your schedule does not permit same time, do it whenever you can, maybe 3 times a week. Make it easy. 5 minutes does make a difference.",

Your video spoke well of your intent and kept me interested. From my experience,  many people seem to like Nature, but many are afraid to participate because of fear or discomfort in being in nature. I try to help ease people into feeling less apprehensive by suggesting they watch a nature show or two, go into their backyard to look at a tree or flower, venture into a city park, etc... You get the point.\n\nI love what I see as your sincerity, though it may be a bit intimidating to some or maybe too much of a time and place commitment to go into Nature for mindfulness. Of course, some just perfer other methods of learning mindfulness. Perhaps in your \"invitation video,\" you slow it down a bit; sit by a slow moving stream or a field of gently moving flowers or such. Make it inviting and calm, while being the honest you.\n\nI appreciate what you're doing and think it's especially important in these uncertain times.

What mindfulness does for me is give me space to determine how I will react tho the emotion.\n\nI can feeling angry. That's perfectly fine. it's neither good nor bad. It's what I do that's important. Anger does not dictate my behavior. I can choose to do something constructive with that energy and that often times leads to other emotions like satisfaction or relief.\n\nI do not fear or avoid any emotion. I control what I do when I feel that emotion.",

    "text": "A bad feeling is a feeling, which is experience, which simply is as it is in this moment and there is a kind of purity in this. It arises and passes due to its conditions, and in this way, it is not personal, though it might seem like it is at times.\n\nAlso, feeling is a kind of intelligence, physical and emotional intelligence.\n\nIt is an experience, and it can be simply experienced, and that can often be helpful. A story, or mental interpretation can be given to it and personal narrative can be created around it, and the mind will tend to do that to some degree. But if you turn to the experience of the feeling and experience it for a while, you can then ask the question, 'is there any suffering in this experience?' Meaning is there suffering in the experience itself, or does it arise from the interpretation of it and the reaction that then comes from that? In other words, is experience in this very moment good or bad, or does that arise from what the mind makes from it?\n\nPain and pleasure are of course genuine things, and a lot of the time what we feel is more like neutral, and tends to get ignored as a result, and that is also true for emotions, and painful emotions can provide a message that something is not right and we need to make changes in some way, the same as physical pain. If change can be made in mind, speech, or body to remove the root cause of that pain in an appropriate way, then we should consider doing that, especially if it is severe. Also possibly regarding one's environment or relationships, but we of course have less control over that. If it cannot be alleviated at this moment in time or if it is more of a passing bad feeling, then we have the opportunity to turn to the experience of the feeling and simply experience it, noticing if there is suffering in the experience or if that comes from what is made out of it by the mind and its habits. Being able to experience feelings with equanimity also allows blocked energy and emotion to release, which can release tension and help in the emotional healing process, at least that is what I have found.\n\nHaving said this, there is also a practice called metta bhavana (loving kindness meditation) which comes from the same tradition that mindfulness originates from (Buddhism), and is often practiced interchangeably with mindfulness sessions, and this is about transmuting emotional energy via well-wishing for self and others, and ultimately for all beings. So it is something worth looking into if you are interested in it.\n\n[https://www.wildmind.org/metta/introduction](https://www.wildmind.org/metta/introduction) \\- here is a good introduction to metta bhavana (loving kindness meditation) from a well established teacher of it, with a written guide as well as a video guided meditation on the webpage",

    "text": "Hey! I just have one quick suggestion. This may just be an issue of semantics, but I don't think it's actually possible to *think about* the present moment. There is really nothing there to think about! All we can really do is notice that we are present. Of course, we are always present - and we were present before we noticed that we were present(!) - but in mindfulness we just notice that consciously. Perhaps this is what you mean by \"bringing \\[your\\] thoughts to the present moment,\" in which case that's all well and good. \n\nIf thoughts arise, either about this process of noticing or anything else, then it really makes no difference to our awareness of the present moment. We are aware - that is what is fundamental - and thoughts may or may not arise within that. Our business, at least while doing this practice, is to avoid being hypnotised by thoughts. But thoughts themselves are not an issue as long as we remain aware of the background within which they are appearing.\n\nIf the issue is that presence dulls both the happiness and the unhappiness, then yes, this can certainly happen. We are very used to identifying heavily with thought, and in that state we are essentially pushed and pulled around by our experience. We have fused with the mind (more or less), and that means that if the mind is happy we are happy, and if it is unhappy we are unhappy. The practice of mindfulness isn't really intended to avoid the unhappy bits and keep the happy bits - it's to get in behind both of these states. If you are able to do that then you might find that what you previously thought of as \"happiness\" was more of a kind of temporary thrill, and that behind the two-sided coin of happiness and unhappiness is a more profound and unchanging kind of happiness which isn't really touched by what happens in our experience.\n\nGood luck!",

I've been practicing for over 20 years... I think it's perfectly normal, as to the science I'm no expert but I feel it's very simply because of a subtle stress, performing anxiety or something like that. I totally agree, the thing to do is to \"be equanimous\", accept that subtle controlling the best you can and just keep doing it (observing the breath). Ok, after many years it does become easier to let go significantly; but for me anyway, retreat definitely helps.",

    "text": "I would say 4 years in the making for me. I also had a very good reason for *wanting* to do this.\n\n\nAfflicted with a stutter all of my life, I learnt from an unconventional source that one way to overcome it is to get rid of the mental habits of anticipation and control of one's speech which creates the stutter in the first place. But you can't just get rid of specific thoughts, especially when they are deeply ingrained 24/7.\n\n\nThe only real way was to take myself to a completely different place where such unproductive thoughts would be incompatible with the new me, hence striving to be present all the time.\n\n\nUnfortunately a lot of it was trial and error and absorbing myself in a variety of contemplative thought from Taoism and Hindu/Buddhism, to Western reframings from figures like Sam Harris and Alan Watts.\n\n\n\"Fixation\" worked well for a while, such as focusing on my breath all day. But the brain will grow tired of this and soon it can become deleterious. Often fixation for me just ends up being 'control' and less awareness.\n\n\nLearning the subtle difference between supressing and letting go of an unwanted hought can take some time. One is like pushing the thought under a rug, the other is accepting it, feeling what ever feelings may accompany that thought, but knowing you have a right to not have to follow or encourage the thought,  and instead gently place your attention elsewhere.\n\n\nI'd say for me the breaking point was when I realised I had become pretty reflexive at letting go of blatantly unproductive thoughts,  but I was still indulging thoughts to do with over controlling my life outside of my speech. When I surrendered and made a commitment to living life as fluidly as possible, it all just seemed to click into place for the most part.\n\n\nSome indicators I have to know if I'm still on the path: do things get done, or do I feel like I'm procrastinating a lot? Am I feeling more stress or peace generally? Do I find myself mindlessly scrolling through short form reddit comments or am I drawn to more long form content :p\n\n\nGentleness is key. Anything that feels like a force of will may work temporarily but I can almost guarantee will come back and bite you if you keep on doing it. And I humble myself and admit to still being a student, hence why I made that post with the 'advice' tag in the first place.",

It is a self-imposed limitation or constraint.\n\nConcepts are useful tools or models for \"dividing the world up\" (duality) but they also aren't universally true (non-duality).\n\nThe problem of identification that mindfulness looks to address is that we've confused the concept for reality which causes us to suffer when there is discord between the perceived truth (the concept) and reality (what the concept attempts to model.)\n\nI think the only real problem or paradox here is that you're attempting to describe reality (non-duality) in dualistic or conceptual terms. Concepts are merely models of reality and will always be insufficient for describing the totality. That doesn't mean they're not useful, we just need to remember their place - as tools, and not elevate them beyond, or mistake them for, reality, direct experience.\n\nSo yes, use and change the concept of self in order to shape your experience but don't forget that it's not \"real\"; it's just something you came up with and it is subject to change.",

    "text": "True. My question of the day is why the truth about “self” is hard to see? And my hunch is that from our earliest moments we are taught our society’s narrative of self, from our parents, from the stories we learn, from the values we are taught. So we are completely steeped in all that thought as we are forming our consciousness. Assuming that the truth about “self” is different than all of that immersive knowledge, it would actually be highly unlikely that we would see it at first glance. We might even dislike our “self” because it doesn’t seem to operate as we expect from what we’ve learned (your point). People say “just be yourself” and we have no clue what that is because there’s no character role written out for us like there was for the Brady Bunch. Anyway, happy April 20!",

    "text": "Never understood the \"self is an illusion\". We have a persona which is what we use to navigate through the world outside. I think what people mean by an illusion is not self but the labels we use to describe ourselves. For example, some people will describe themselves as introverts, yet when you ask them if they have ever been extroverts, they will say \"Of course\". So what are they saying then? Means nothing.\n\nWhat we should be saying about ourselves is that \"I am the totality of every emotion/trait I have ever experienced\". That is more accurate. So pigeon-holing yourself is the illusion.\n\nThe problem people face with not labelling themselves is the comfort that they feel when they internally say they are an introvert, and they indeed have an (say) evening where they are introverted, and then they can tell themselves \"See? I told you I'm an introvert\".",

    "text": "For those with existential angst about self vs. non-self, I highly recommend Iain McGilchrist's book \"The Master and His Emissary\". Here's a few points generated by ChatGPT:\n\nIain McGilchrist's \"no-self\" concept, rooted in Buddhist thought and his own analysis of brain lateralization, suggests that the  perceived \"self\" is a construct, a narrative we create based on  neurological and experiential processes, rather than a fixed,  fundamental entity. He  emphasizes that the left hemisphere, while crucial for logical thought  and analytical understanding, can also create a sense of a fixed,  independent \"self\" that is not a true reflection of reality.             Here's a more detailed breakdown of McGilchrist's perspective:     \n\nThe Illusion of Self: McGilchrist  argues that the left hemisphere, with its tendency towards  categorization, linearity, and a focus on the \"object\" of experience,  can lead to the misidentification of the individual as a separate,  self-contained entity. \n\n Brain Lateralization: He  highlights how the right hemisphere, with its capacity for holistic,  intuitive understanding and a focus on the \"subject\" of experience,  offers a different perspective on reality. \n\n The Narrative of the Self: McGilchrist  suggests that the \"self\" is not a fundamental aspect of reality but  rather a story we construct, a narrative built upon the experiences we  have and the way our brains process them. \n\n Implications for Meaning: He  explores how the concept of no-self can impact our understanding of  meaning and the nature of reality, arguing that it can lead to a greater  sense of interconnectedness and a more profound appreciation for the  present moment. \n\n Beyond Identity: McGilchrist  suggests that while our sense of identity changes, there's a deeper  sense of \"self\" that involves awareness, observation, and consciousness. \n\n\n\nIn  essence, McGilchrist's \"no-self\" concept is not about denying the  existence of individuals or their experiences, but rather about  challenging the notion that a fixed, separate \"self\" is the core of our  being. He  suggests that by understanding the processes involved in creating the  sense of self, we can gain a more accurate and nuanced understanding of  ourselves and our place in the world.",

Not saying that’s the answer though.\n\nSome things that could help: \n\nPlanning each day the day before. Gives you time to consider what you’d like to get done and in what order. I’m so fucked without a to-do list, I just flounder. Make sure you schedule things for your own enjoyment too, not just the things deemed important.\n\nJournaling: I write in journal to myself to organise my tasks and manage my to do list, usually after a coffee before I start studying or working, and then intermittently throughout the day to organise my thoughts. I think it’s almost similar to self-induced body-doubling (doing tasks with someone around) which seems to be good for people with ADHD.\n\nExercise: if you’re like me you like to feel you’ve accomplished something and enjoy a sense of progression. Working out daily is great for that, as well as the endorphins and physical improvements, and gives a sense of structure to your day, especially if you do it first thing. If you haven’t lifted before you’ll be able to do more reps from one workout to another.\n\nSomething creative: flow state induced by making music completely shuts off my brain and makes the time pass REALLY quickly (in a satisfying way). Gives the same sense of skill development and engages your mind.\n\nReading: get into a really good book that grips you.\n\nThey’re my strategies. I probably need more. Good luck!",

What really helped was starting with **micro-moments**. Literally, 60 seconds of just *watching* my breath, no pressure to feel calm, no expectation of doing it right. I’d just sit, feel the tension in my chest, and *notice* it. Sometimes I’d name it: *“tight... anxious... okay.”*\n\nEventually I found that the goal wasn’t to “clear my mind,” but just to stop *arguing with what was happening*. That shift made all the difference.\n\nOne specific practice that worked for me was **Box Breathing**:  \nBreathe in for 4… hold for 4… out for 4… hold for 4. Repeat.  \nIt gives your anxious brain a task, and brings back a bit of control when everything feels chaotic.\n\nIf you want more tips, check the \"Stress Reduction\" method of [Anxiety University](https://anxietychecklist.com/anxiety-university) where I share practical tools that helped me regain clarity. Nothing woo-woo. Just stuff that actually worked.",

It didnt happen. Yeah I had heaps of time but it was also a period of turmoil and change and that is its own thing to work through. Not to mention the stress of job hunting. The good news is i actually did do a lot of the things i wanted, but after starting work when i had less time but more stability.\n\nId say be kind to yourself, you just finished a PhD which is huge and unemployment its stressful and exhausting. Rather than trying to maintain that PhD pace, give yourself some time to recover and aim to do less, just the things you need to. You might those extra hobbies like woodwork and spanish will cover later when things are more stable.",

Especially in the heat of the moment of doing something during the day I often have some internal dialogue which will go something like this: \"You should get up and do something, don't waste the day\" then I'll reply \"that is a thought based off of guilt and unfounded deeply held beliefs\" then it will say \"well what are you going to do then just lie here?\" \"yeah if I want to, I don't need to to strive to do anything\" then it will say \"but how will you get anything done?\" then normally at some point I just get confused and stressed because I still only have a shallow understanding of mindfulness and I'll just do something that makes me feel good or just get task anxiety and lay there.

Could take some experimenting to figure out what works best for you.\n\nThe other thing that is a fucking lifesaver for me and could be useful for this is the pomodoro technique, where you start a timer and work in 25 minute increments with a 5 minute break between. For me, instead of trying to finish bigger tasks I try to work on them for a specific amount of time every day. Like 3 hrs of study with subtasks in my to-do list then 3 hrs of work. Speaking of sub-tasks, that helps a lot with the to-do list as well. Breaking down bigger tasks into smaller parts helps a lot with overwhelm - being unsure what to do next makes me paralysed, so the more clarity in steps to take the better.\n\nYou seem like a really smart person - if you experiment (and you could brainstorm/journal about your experiments) I’m sure you’ll find some creative methods that work best for you!

Therefore, we must learn to be rooted, grounded in the present, and mindfulness does that.

What helped me is:\n\n\\-Eddy Burbacks video on getting rid of your phone, which motivated me to only use my phone for messages and calls. That helped my ADHD a lot, I can now concentrate better and feel generally calmer not having something stealing my concentration every other minute.\n\n\\-10-15 min meditation every morning (preferibly supported by the Insight Timer app, using bells to stay in the present) while having a notebook in front of me and writing down things I need to/want to do so I don't need to keep them in my head.\n\nIt took me months of being unemployed/applying for jobs to find this rutine and I am so much better off for it.

Such an amazing achievement. Time consuming, stress induced top tier education. What an amazing accomplishment. I think it’s okay to give yourself permission to just enjoy life for a little bit. Let’s make this real shall we? Create a list of let’s say one hobby and three place or things you’d like to experience. Next create a timeline where you will take the job hunt very seriously. Now you can physically see your goals on paper with a realistic timeline. A lot of time we u consciously create these “permission slips” where we say that we can only feel a specific positive way if we meet certain conditions.  But I’m sure you maybe did that while you were going through college (I’ll do that once I complete my degree) as an example. Maybe go easier on yourself and just do whatever you want to do with this time and when the date comes up to start looking for work more seriously that is when you can execute your professional life. But until then, execute your freedom life. You never know what you might discover that can lead down a path you’d never follow because you were too focused on this road which made you miss that road. Keep your head up. I believe in you.",

    "text": "1.In order to more clearly see what is judgment and what is not you might replace judgment with the word interpretation and contrast with this concrete, objective fact. You mention you just think you're somewhat mentally ill - this is an interpretation or judgment. It's not something you can objectively point to. An objective statement which this judgment could be based on might be \"I took a mental health quiz and scored 4 out of 10.\" To put it another way, judgment is assigning meaning to objective observations.\n\n2. Our unconscious rejection of aspects of experience prevent us from totally seeing them, from being present with them. It takes time, practice and patience to come more fully into the present. You might see it as not black and white, present or not, but rather a degree of awareness.\n\nConsider anything one can develop a nuanced sense of as an analogy. For example when you taste your first glass of wine you have a very blunt experience of it compared to someone who has spent years exploring different wine. And even the experienced wine taster still has deeper, perhaps endless, potential for learning to recognize further nuances. This is the same with experience or present awareness - there are many things hidden in plain sight that will only come into focus with practice.\n\n3. Whatever is occurring, just be with it. The aim is not a silent mind but equanimity towards all that the mind can produce. You realize there's nothing you can really *do* about it. Can you just be? Even in spite of it?\n\n>is the point basically still the same as self-distraction?\n\nNot at all. You might say meditation is the opposite of distraction.\n\n>does something else happen?\n\nYes, you might realize there's no need for distraction. Everything is okay and acceptable, even pain, as it is. But the catch is, knowing this, it can't be your aim otherwise it merely becomes another strategy for distraction.",

It means you allow it to come, to be, and to go. You welcome it whether it’s pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, or both. \n\nTo be present means to be clear about what you’re experiencing. But it comes back again to equanimity. Just being present doesn’t necessarily help. But learning not to fight with your experience helps. That’s equanimity. Most of our struggles are because we fight with our experience or we try to hold onto it. Let it come, let it be, let it go, all naturally. \n\nYes, what we resist, persists. If you’re trying to block out an uncomfortable thought, that’s not mindfulness. If it comes up, let it come up. Treat it like a cloud in the sky of your awareness. It comes, it floats by, and it goes away. Even if it’s uncomfortable, it will pass. Everything does. With mindfulness you can witness things passing in real time, which makes it easier to believe.",

We have to get a little bit comfortable being uncomfortable. It can also help to focus our attention away on something else that is comfortable. Then we can let the unpleasant be in the background while a more pleasant sensation can be in the foreground. \nAnother strategy is to relax around the unpleasant experience. We usually tense up around discomfort. If you consciously relax around it, it can help to let go of some of the resistance. Hope this was a helpful response.",

    "text": "Gonna be 38 soon and also working through intrusive thoughts and Ill give you my perspective. I do have a therapist and have read a buttload of stuff, as well as have gotten over this a few years ago. I stopped my practice, stress built up and...tadaa.\n\n1. Nonjudgement for me is more like a \"yeah thats a thing\". Even \"mentally ill\" is biased toward there being some sort of \"mentally fit\". Nonjudgment is more like \"yeah my thoughts bounce\" period. Not labelling ill, wrong, bad. The best analogy I see with this is that you dont blame your nose as bad because it smelled poop. You know you smelled poop, it alerts you and thats about it.\n\n2. Yeah screaming in your face is distracting. I have 2 kids and the analogy is that if you live with them long enough and trust they are safe you do actually zone them out. Back to poo, if you are in a room with poo you eventually stop sensing it. Your nose still has the sensory but your awareness knows its not a threat and ignores it. Its also why your nose sits in your vision and you never \"see\" it. And also  its why doctors and nurses need sound breaks because after a while they literally stop hearing the alarms in rooms. The more fuel you add to the intrusion being worthy of attention, the more the mind will pull your attention to it. \n\nI get it though, the shit sucks and can be really emotionally charged. In fact, no one ever gets happy intrusive thoughts right? They would be daydreams, they wouldnt captivate our attention and they would shortly fade. But from my experience and pretty much every damn therapy and approach Ive read, the answer is the one I dislike: see it, accept  that its noisy brain waves and nothing more, and it goes away. The more safe you feel when they pop and the less you pay the attention the quicker they can fade. \n\n3. You SOB I was winning for so long...\n\nBest of luck with it because they can be wicked terrible.",

    "text": "Very good questions. Others have already answered some of this. Here's another answer, maybe it will be useful.\n\n\"Judgement\" is somewhat misleading, I think, because it implies something a lot more deliberate than what mindfulness is about. Of course, not judging what's going on, in the sense your average person understands it, can be helpful, but in mindfulness we go a lot further than that. In fact, \"this hurts\" is also a \"judgement\". I bet that doesn't completely fit what you'd think of as \"judgement\", so here's a different way to think of it: abstraction. Buddhists, for instance, differentiate between pain and suffering. Pain is the raw sensation from your nervous system. Suffering is what it turns into when you contrast that pain to a different, pain-free state, and very much want the pain to go away and to have that pain-free state instead. On top of the raw sensations, you add your interpretation of the pain (put simply, \"it sucks\"), and that's what makes it a struggle. How is it even possible to feel differently, you might ask... and that's not easy to answer. Dealing with acute pain (or, for that matter, intrusive thoughts) as a beginner to mindfulness is extraordinarily difficult. It's like trying to run when you haven't even learned to stand. Sorry if that's a let-down, but while mindfulness can be extremely effective, you don't get the results for free. You have to put in time and practice. No way around that, I'm afraid.\n\nSo, how would you go about that? Practice mindfulness in a more \"training wheels\" sort of way. This is why most of the beginner resources go on and on about breathing exercises. For most people, the breath is something that isn't emotionally charged, and it's easy for them to practice their awareness of the breath, to learn to notice when their attention wanders and awareness fades, and so forth. Some people struggles doing that with the breath, but it can really be done with absolutely anything. I struggled with the breathing things when I was starting out, and what I did was take walks and try to expand my awareness of my surroundings – not by trying to focus on everything, but by focusing less on any one thing; basically trying to stay \"open\", in a playful sort of way.\n\nOf course, if intrusive thoughts and such are very frequent for you, there's a very good chance they'll pop up while you're doing beginner-level exercises. When you're starting out, it's not particularly likely you'll manage to apply mindfulness to them in such a way that it will actually start making a difference right away. So, for now, you'll have to accept that you can't control these thoughts in any meaningful way (I'm sure you've tried all sorts of things but none of them are effective, right? Well, it's going to keep being like that for a while longer, that's part of the journey). While doing exercises, let them exist, be okay with them screaming at you, even be okay with feeling stressed out about the screaming thoughts... and the only thing you have to try is to stay aware of something else (e.g. your breath, or the world around you, or the sensations in your arms and legs) at the same time. It absolutely isn't the goal to focus so hard that they disappear, or anything like that. We don't do that in mindfulness. We never try to remove anything. All we do is keep our awareness as broad as we can.\n\nOver time, you will start being able to let more things happen. What you have right now is a lot of \"mental programs\" that are layered on top of each other: a program that brings up the thoughts, a program that conjures feelings related to those thoughts, a program that replays thoughts about these feelings (ever notice how some thoughts are \"replays\" and others are \"fresh\", and somehow these two different types of thinking feel almost exactly the same?), a program with feelings about those thoughts, and who knows what else.\n\nWith mindfulness, over time you gain the ability so slowly unpeel this stack of programs, layer by layer. First the feelings about your thoughts about the feelings might start to fade, and then maybe the thoughts about the feelings will get a little less, and so, ever so slowly, things will start to shift. But this only progresses whenever you manage to not get \"sucked in\"; whenever you can be mindful of one of these layers. You may not be able to be equanimous about the intrusive thoughts for quite some time, but a fair bit sooner it might be easier to let your thoughts *about* those thoughts happen without trying to change them, control them, suppress them, judge them, etc... and that's when the magic starts happening, even if it will be extremely subtle at first.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind when trying to learn something like this while you're in the thick of it is that you need to pace yourself. Spending two hours trying to force yourself to be mindful is not just a waste of time, it might even make it harder to learn it for real. The ideal way to practice mindfulness is with just enough of a challenge not feel hard. So, see how long you can let those intrusive thoughts happen and make no attempt to stop or reduce or change them, while also staying aware of, for example, your breathing. If it's just five seconds before it starts feeling like you're struggling, that's just fine. Your mind will learn. Ten or twenty five-second \"mini-sessions\" a day are still practice. I wouldn't go to extremes with this (a hundred mini-sessions are maybe a bit too much), but the point is feel free to split it as much as you like, especially when starting out. In a while maybe you'll be able to do a minute five times per day or so. The goal isn't to set records, though, or to sit down for an hour at a time (you can do that, but you don't have to). The goal is to increase your ability to stay mindful. All practice matters for that.\n\nJust once more to make it absolutely clear: mindfulness is not about stopping anything. It's about getting out of the way. It might be difficult to believe, but when it works, it really does work. If you practice for a while, you'll probably start noticing this with smaller things, that might normally be difficult for you to put out of your mind, but with a bit of mindfulness they'll sort of resolve themselves just by you observing them.\n\nHere's another way of thinking about mindfulness that I found helpful to illustrate things: if a bunch of intrusive thoughts and feelings are like a raging river with massive currents, being mindful/aware is dipping your toes in, and managing to stay right there at the edge where you can absolutely notice it all happening, but without getting swept along. As a beginner you'll sometimes dip in a little too far and get swept up by the currents (i.e. lose the awareness and kind of get focused exclusively on the current and before you know it, you're going round and round in circles with looping thoughts and feelings). Any second you manage to strike the balance where it's all there and you're still managing to stay in the present will contribute a tiny bit toward resolution.\n\nHow does this even work, though? I'm not sure anyone has a definite answer, but this is how I think about it: any mental \"effort\" (in the most abstract sense) you put into stuff that's going on reinforces it a little bit. That includes getting swept up in the thoughts, but also trying to push them away, or trying to argue with them. We're all very good at trying to solve this sort of thing with mental effort, because that's all we were ever told could be done. If we stopped doing that, the reinforcing would stop, and things that don't get reinforced will fade over time. Even if they never disappeared completely, 95% would be quite a bit of progress, right? So, the goal here is to unlearn the habit of trying to fix everything with mental effort. We all know that none of the things we ever try really work, anyway, but with no reference experience it's scary to give \"don't do anything whatsoever\" a try. That's another reason why you shouldn't go straight for trying to resolve the big issues: it's much easier to fully commit to this approach once you've seen it work on, for instance, some minor annoyances you've had in the past that you can actually *experience* shifting while doing *absolutely nothing*.\n\nMy first time I experienced that as a thing that's actually real was one time when I started getting pins and needles in one of my feet... you know, the kind of thing that just happens randomly every now and then. Normally we feel like we need to do something to get rid of that, right? Shake it out, jump around, that sort of thing. Except this time I decided to just let the sensation happen and do absolutely nothing to stop it, just to see what would happen. It felt a little uncomfortable because it went against every habit and intuition of mine, but it seemed doable. And what happened is that for a while the sensation got stronger, and then somehow, impossibly, it peaked and started fading. Not because I tried to get it to fade – I didn't even *expect* it to fade – but simply from observing and waiting to see what would happen. See a trace of that non-judgemental-ness in there? I didn't observe because I wanted it gone; I observed because I was sort of curious. That seems to be the ideal state of mind. Since then, I've become better at being \"curious\" about things where, in the past, it would have been difficult for me to not feel \"I need this gone *now*\". I can't do it with everything, but I keep improving, I think.\n\nJust to reiterate, this is far from a quick fix for bigger issues. If you're willing to get started anyway (in the right way, without trying to disregard those intrusive thoughts and feelings), I'm confident you'll get there eventually. I'll be happy to answer any additional questions you might want to ask, even if it's two years from now. I can't promise quick responses, but I *will* respond eventually.",

    "text": "I do understand that fully because I have been there and I still have limiting beliefs that pop out but they are really deeply rooted and it doesn’t happen as often. \nI have found out from Bashar (check his teachings about limiting beliefs) and it has been extremely helpful to say the following when you catch a limiting belief: I feel (fear, guilt, shame, whatever) because I choose to believe that it serves me. It is simple and grounding, and after that just noticing how that limiting belief has played out in your life. This is the process of letting go of the belief. The rest is just habitual behaviour that you need to be aware of and adjust accordingly. The thing with the habitual behaviour is that once I let go of limiting belief, I begin to feel more and more discomfort if I repeat it.\nHope that helps.",

    "text": "Hey OP. This is just what the untrained mind is like, no need to be hard on yourself because this wasn’t something that you did. Awareness pulls attention away to something that is deemed more important or interesting. We don’t control awareness, this is just the anatta or no-self nature of the mind. \n\nYour aversion towards your losing mindfulness will only make it worse. It is understandable of course because you want to be more present but negative reinforcement does not work. \n\nYou can view attention as a cute little puppy, it will easily get bored so all the time it is checking out new things, barking at this, chewing on that. When the puppy comes back to you (when you «wake up» and realize that your mind has wandered), you reward it - you must find some joy or contentment in being present again. Maybe just feel for a moment how nice it is to be present and to let go of thinking/craving/aversion whatever the puppy was doing. This way the puppy will want to come running back to you more often in the future. \n\nNow I totally understand that it is difficult to feel joy of becoming present again in that situation. I have done that myself many times and I also felt the embarrassment but that is why we practice, right?",

In it, G describes in detail a psychological system he called the fourth way, a designation that distiguishes it from these three ways: \n1• the developement of instinctive/physical self-mastery he called the way of the fakir.\n2• the deveplopement/ mastery of one’s emotional capacity.He called this the way of the monk. It is largely religious in nature and language.\n3• the development/mastery\nof the intellectual mind, which he called the way of the yogi.\n\nThis system engages all these functions/qualities in a harmonious framework of psychological and cosmological knowledge that encourages efforts of understanding and verification \nas opposed to faith and belief.\n\nMy practice takes form within a school accessible at oldnewmethod.\nIf I give you the website address(just add a “com”)\nthe robotic moderation scheme might delete my comment.\nJim",

The idea of sitting with a painful or disruptive emotion scares us to death, and we'll do anything to get away from it, when just allowing what is to be, until it's gone, is the key to ridding ourselves of it entirely. \n\nEvery time I face these thoughts and emotions instead of distracting myself, I end up laughing at how easy it was. Far more easier than putting it and keeping it on the back burner, trying to keep those thoughts from slipping in or bugging me later.",

    "text": "I don’t know, and you don’t know either, and nobody knows, not even those who can do it. Because toughts and knowledge (the intellect) are not related to awareness. Its the difference between knowledge/intellect and instincts/ intuitive wisdom, emotions etc.\n\nFor example, I could ask you, how do you move your arm? You could’nt answer me, yet you know how to do it. How do you let go? You do not know but you (hopefully) no how to do it. How can you forgive? They are all things we do with intuitive wisdom, that is learned through awareness, not through verbal speech, intellect etc..\n\nIt is what people call in the west the mind and the heart. To be honest, I have no idea if these stories are true, or if that state can be reached, but one thing is sure, if you were to reach it you could not go there by intellectualization.\n\nYou need to get better at feeling things, eliminate all your bad habits by observing your mind 24/7, the truth is most people do not even know why they react the way they do sometimes, it is only out of habit. You need to eliminate all things tought to you by society, how pain is bad, how the dark is to be feared, you need to be reborn in every moment, take nothing for granted, have no expectations (I could keep going for hours, you understand the idea).  Some monks call this « practice as if your head was on fire ». Assume that everything in life even the most small as something to teach you. Be so humble that you will consider even a child to be smarter than you.\n\nYou cant cut corners to reach such a state, only with extreme dedication, studying (buddhist texts or sutras for example) and trying to understand them extremely deeply, not in the form of toughts but in the form of intuitive wisdom, may you possibly reach this state. You need to be aware 100% of the time, everything you do as to be done with intention, walking this path is extremely beneficial and feels very great but if you even let doubt or thoughts or pleasure or emotions obscure your awareness for even a moment you will lose your path.\n\nEven if you met somebody who could do such a thing, he could not explain it to you, as you couldnt explain to somebody how to move your arm. He could point you towards a path that will lead to you understanding, but he cannot make you understand. hope this helps.",

They both are shorthand for the same thing, that I went to the medical system and got a diagnosis for mental illness from psychiatrists. Maybe I need another example.\n\nThis is where I get really frustrated. I always get told I'm just not good enough and haven't practiced enough. I have actually practiced these things but I get hung up on these topics repeatedly. I can't practice what I don't know how to practice. I don't know how much more in the moment or aware I have to be, other than \"more\". After 15 years of therapy I'm not sure what to do here.\n\nI don't understand what it means to be as in a verb. I am being already.. when something negative occurs I am with it. I'm not sitting and trying to think of ways out or anything, it's just there. That doesn't make me feel any different. If your life is constant pain from when you wake up until you sleep are you supposed to accept that? Is it extreme stoicism? I just don't feel I'm mentally capable of doing this. I don't think what you're saying is wrong, I just think I can't do it. And I don't know what to do because it's what I always get hung up on in therapy every time. like you say it's inherently illogical - if you seek it you can't have it. well i can't help but want it, i can't change what i want and how i feel.",

The interpretation is relative, meaning it is entirely dependent upon the interpreter's perspective. One could easily argue for another interpretation like \"I have a good amount of savings.\" One could not argue against the fact because it merely is.\n\nSimilarly \"I'm somewhat mentally ill\" is an interpretation. If one looked at the underlying facts they could argue for a different interpretation. In a sense, what meditation is asking us to do, is to sit with the facts and recognize interpretations as merely one possible perspective among infinite. Meditation is sitting with \"I do not know.\"\n\nBut it's not necessary to understand that so let's put it aside for now and take a different approach. Let me see if I understand you.\n\nIt sounds like you're tired of others telling you you're not \"there yet\" or \"you don't get it.\" As you said, you've done the practice and a lot of therapy. It's like there's this invisible goal that people are trying to convince you is real but you can't seem to reach it.\n\nPeople respond to your questions with statements like \"just be\" or \"don't resist\" but you're already being and you're not resisting. You can get the general idea, you understand the words but it doesn't connect to your experience and it doesn't help with the pain. It's exhausting! You want what you want and you feel what you feel.\n\nIs that right?",

    "text": "That's such a powerful insight to receive during meditation—*“don’t focus on the lesson you want to teach her, but the lesson she is teaching you.”* That shift alone is already a kind of awakening.\n\nThe tricky part is that life lessons aren’t always loud or obvious. They’re subtle, lived-in things we uncover slowly through how we *respond* rather than how we *react*. So if you’re trying to find the lesson, start by asking yourself a few gentle questions:\n\n* **What part of me is most triggered by this person?** Is it your need for control, validation, fairness, boundaries?\n* **Is this dynamic reminding me of something from my past?** Often difficult people tap on old wounds that still want healing.\n* **How am I being invited to grow here?** Patience, detachment, self-respect, communication, self-trust, even surrender—any of those could be the lesson.\n\nWhen we want things to stop repeating, it's usually not because the universe is punishing us—it’s because something inside us wants to evolve. And sometimes we don’t “solve” the problem externally—we outgrow it, energetically, emotionally. That doesn’t mean tolerating abuse or mistreatment—but it can mean learning how to *respond with strength and compassion*, which is wildly empowering.\n\nYou’re already approaching this with a deep sense of awareness and intention. Keep doing what you’re doing: stay present, stay curious, and when in doubt, choose love—but don’t forget that love can look like boundaries, too.",

    "text": "I get it. It is a strange concept. I like to think of it in terms of a skill that mindfulness develops, according to the system I teach, which is \"equanimity.\" Equanimity means to let our sensory experience come and go without push or pull. That's what I mean by letting things be. It means we don't push or pull. What does that mean? Well pushing would mean resisting or suppressing. In the example of sadness it would be denying that you felt sad. Ignoring it, telling yourself you aren't really sad. Trying anything to get out of feeling sad. Pull is when we cling to something, usually something pleasant. When we want it to last forever or we want more and more and are never satisfied.  \nSo equanimity means not to resist what we're experiencing and not to hold onto it.  \nSo what would equanimity with sadness mean?  \nI just experienced this yesterday. And actually my sadness was mostly from loneliness so it's relatable. I had the urge to get rid of the sadness any way I could. I was thinking about all the strategies. Then I remembered my mindfulness and I realized I was trying to push the sadness away. So I instead allowed myself to feel sad. I just gave myself permission to be sad. I was no longer resisting and even though I felt sad, I was no longer fighting with my experience, so energy was freed up. I felt better in just allowing it to happen.  \nIt's not that I didn't care about being sad. I just stopped trying to stop feeling sad and let it happen, having compassion for myself for feeling sad.  \nLater when the sadness had passed on its own, which tends to happen to me when I allow myself to feel something, I was able to come up with some strategies for connection that might help with my loneliness.  \nSo hopefully that's an example that makes it somewhat clearer.\n\nNow it's not easy to have equanimity. You can't usually just decide to do it. Taking on an attitude of \"allowing\" can help. But ultimately, it's a skill that you train over time by doing mindfulness practice. So my recommendation is do the practice, and remember that it's a long term project. You develop equanimity over time, and an individual meditation session is not always going to feel helpful in the short term.  \nGood luck with your search for a therapist. And good luck with your mindfulness practice, I hope it leads to some relief.",

But over time it can really help.  \nDistracting oneself can be a good strategy for chronic pain. I get that. When I'm flaring up badly it seems to be the only thing that can help. But mindfulness offers a strategy of instead of distracting ourself, to escape right into the pain. It's a challenge for sure. And it takes specific strategies to be able to apply it. And it takes time to develop the mindfulness skills to get proficient at it. I'm not fully there. But my mindfulness does really help with dealing with my pain.

    "text": "if you read daniel goleman's 'emotional intelligence' it goes into the relationship between logic and emotions in decisions, in terms of science's views. One view that comes up in this, is that possible options are laid out through logic, but the actual decision comes through emotion. I.e. we have a stronger positive feeling towards, or negative against things, which sways us one way or another.\n\nSo although it can feel like we're blocking out a lot of emotions in decision making, there is still always some emotion there showing us a preference. Also then i'm guessing maybe you suppress a range of emotions, especially ones that have led to bad decisions/outcomes, while still working with emotions that you're much clearer about/comfortable with.\n\nOn the issue of suppressing emotions, that can be a whole other issue. Where suppressing them can lead to them being stored as tension in the body etc. These emotions don't so much need to take the driving seat though, more that they are better to be released from the system. One system that works to do this, and train us in this process, is outlined here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei\\_gong\\_from\\_a\\_more\\_mentalemotional\\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/1gna86r/qinei_gong_from_a_more_mentalemotional_healing/)",

But not sure if people with adhd can e.g. sit and play video games for hours on end so that's why I assume I have no adhd. \n\n\nYes maybe you are right this might be more useful to neurotypical people. And yes I think the actions that are ranked higher in our dopamine table are more pleasurable but again, novelty/frequency matters. I can't do a line of cocaine and then do another one in the minute after because I know I would have a heart attack, no matter how pleasurable the experience is. But the more time passes, the more the idea of doing another line is reinforced. \n\n\nAnd again, as a neurotypical person who has suffered from cPTSD, I view dopamine chasing as a means to fill emotional void and ego feeling bad (e.g. Bad day at work -> Jerk off once I go home). The more emotional trauma you have or the more negative emotions you accrue from your everyday life, the higher this dopamine need will be.\n\nBut again, I don't know how this translates to someone with ADHD or other mental illnesses (OCD, Schizophrenia, BPD, etc).",

I could feel those little tiny muscles that fire to rotate your eye when you look just slightly to the left or right, I could feel my heart beat and expand and push whatever else was around it in and out, I could feel the air coming in my lungs, I could notice my eyes shaking from the closed eye visuals, almost as if receiving actual rays of light.",

    "text": "Short version: any time spent matters, but don't overdo it. Whenever it starts feeling like more than a minor amount of struggle, stop. That said, you can totally do multiple sessions per day.\n\n\n\nLonger version:\n\nThe specifics would depend a bit on you, and there are different ways of approaching it. \n\n\nMost beginners tend to get distracted fairly easily, mostly by random thoughts: some thought comes to mind and because it's what you've been doing all the time, you'll naturally follow the chain of thoughts that comes after it, losing track of the objective to stay in the present moment. \n\n\nThe most well-known and probably most popular way is to focus on something like your breath, because most people feel very neutral about their breath and there's no struggle associated with it, so you don't have to worry about getting distracted by emotions and such. It's not that the goal is being able to focus on your breath, that's just the exercise. The goal is being able to stay present no matter what's going through your mind (though in practice you'll probably never get to a perfect 100%).\n\n\nDistraction is a normal part of practice and each time you do get distracted and eventually notice that you got distracted, that's progress. After a while you'll notice faster and get distracted less often. So, in a way, distraction is actually helping you because you're learning from it. That means that distraction doesn't mean you have to stop.\n\n\nMost people will start getting a little restless or frustrated after a while, and that does make it harder. Ideally you'd keep going, making no attempt to stop or change the restlessness (in mindfulness we never really block anything out, we just might decide to put a little more focus on some things than on others), and if that starts feeling like a struggle, you'd end the session before you start falling into old habits like trying to \"manage\" those feelings and sensations. So, the amount of frustration you experience sort of puts a natural limit on how long an ideal session would be for you. You'd always push a little outside of what's comfortable for you and no further than that, and in my experience that's the fastest way to extend your comfort zone. \n\n\nWithin those parameters you can spend as much time as you like each day (you can always do another session a little later, when you're back to a neutral state of mind), but at least for the first month I think there's probably not much use in going above 10 or maybe 20 minutes a day. After that point you'll probably have a much better idea of what's right for you and then you can make your own decisions about it.\n\n\nHope this helps!",

In my experience, the best way to get there is to keep an open mind about the answer and resist the temptation of going to look for the answer.

There are many things that increase seeking behaviors but not liking behaviors.\n\nAs for the ego, that’s located in the PFC and psychedelics shut down the DMN and PFC more which is why you feel less ego on them.\n\nWhen you indulge in a quick reward that floods your brain with dopamine, to maintain homeostasis your body will combat that and bring you down lower in mood, and every big rush brings you lower and lower in baseline levels and so u have to keep doing more and more of the drug just to get back up to your original baseline level. \nHealthy habits such as going to the gym don’t cause a surge of dopamine though, and gradually increase levels\n\nYou’re right tho, without dopamine ppl would have no motivation and would actually die. They would have no desires to seek out food, etc. it is necessary to keep us going, keeping it in balance is the hard part",

    "text": "This used to be me. I did all the things I logically thought I should - got a good degree, lucrative career, bought a house, got married but in spite of my accomplishments I was unhappy. I seemed to repeat the same pattern over and over - choose a new logical goal (get a raise), achieve that goal, be somewhat content for a while, misery returns, find new goal, rinse and repeat.\n\nAs a logically-minded engineer, I thought emotions were weak and useless. I suppose I recognized that I had some of them but I didn't really allow them in. I was afraid they would cause me to make poor \"emotionally-driven\" decisions. Feeling emotions was something for the weak-minded, weak-willed, I thought.\n\nEventually I got tired of being unhappy and repeating the same patterns. I started to understand I was the cause of my own suffering and repression of my emotions was detrimental, at the very least, to my ability to laugh, love and enjoy life. So I started exploring getting in touch with my emotions. As something that initially comes naturally to human beings I felt very inept at it. Most of the time I had no idea whether I was actually in touch with my emotions, what they were or what that would even look like.\n\nI started coming across teachers like Joe Hudson who talked about how emotions are essential to effective decision making. There's even some evidence that all decisions are emotionally driven and that the logic only comes in after the decision has been emotionally decided to fill in the \"rational explanation.\"\n\nI realized, with some help and lots of reading, that most of my decisions were actually attempts to avoid situations where I might have to feel repressed emotions and this was the reason I kept repeating the same patterns. It was also the reason some decisions were so difficult - both outcomes had potential emotional consequences I didn't want to face.\n\nAs I continued in my journey to understand my emotions, more and more came to the surface and I became more adept at recognizing and working with them. I started becoming happier for no apparent reason and more capable of enjoying life (which also translates into becoming more successful and motivated.) I stopped trying to reason my way through decisions and started feeling through them and, subsequently, making much better decisions which yielded better and better results.\n\nI won't lie though, there are times when it gets messy and very uncomfortable. I don't think I could have convinced my younger self to go through this process; I had to recognize my own suffering and suffer enough that I was motivated to do something uncomfortable and uncertain. It takes a bit of a leap of faith at first but over time you'll recognize the benefit of emotions. They're like an internal compass that somehow seems to know the best direction (but only if you allow them in.)",

There are many ways to be present, and live in the now. Maybe you have a hobby you're great at, or you know how to produce videos and upload them to YouTube. Maybe you enjoy reading or watching movies. Or answering questions on Reddit like me :D Whatever you find your hand do, even if it's just mowing the lawn, put 100% of yourself into it.

You will probably say two wrongs don't make a right, and I'll one is an obvious wrong and harmful (stimulants + porn/edging + sleep deprivation), and the other is more neutral (psychedelics can be either positive or negative).",

Thoughts are like guests visiting the mind from time to time. They come and go. To overcome thoughts, one has to constantly develop awareness, as this will watch over thoughts so that they hardly arise. Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements. Whenever you realize you've lost awareness, simply return to it. do it continuously and awareness will grow stronger and stronger, it will intercept thoughts and make them shorter and fewer. the mind will return to its natural state, which is clean, bright and peaceful. one can practice through out the day from the moment we wake up until falling asleep, while sitting, walking, eating, washing, etc. practice naturally, in a relaxed way, without tension, without concentrating or forcing attention.

    "text": "Because you are not demonstrating that you value yourself, those with whom you interact also do not value you.\n\nCompassion is wonderful. But you have to put your own mask on before you help others. By having healthy boundaries, you demonstrate your value to others.\n\nConversely, when you’re willing to let others trample you, you will attract people who want someone to trample. By continuing to interact, you’re teaching these people that their behavior is acceptable and welcomed. These are not people who are candidates for good reciprocal friendships.\n\nI’ve watched others go through what you describe. When people are so eager to fill their cup that they put others before themselves, they make victims of themselves. Learn to have healthy regard for yourself, and to show compassion from a position of strong sense of self and self-worth. Healthy narcissism, some people call it. How you value yourself set the tone for how others will value you, so you demonstrate how you want to be valued by your actions.\n\nStart expecting reciprocity. Start setting terms when you engage with others like, I drove last time, will you drive today? This will not make you a transactional bastard. What it will do is demonstrate that just as you value them, they must value you. \n\nOur friends are the people who support us. Not the people who are simply willing to spend time with us. If you’re looking for friendship, look for demonstrations of support.\n\nSecond, think deeply about what you are accountable for, and what each individual is accountable for. You cannot take accountability for others. I say this because you mentioned ‘showing them the way’. You can model good behavior, but you cannot guide people to change. Many people spend too much energy trying to take accountability for things that they cannot. You’re accountable for your choices and actions, and others are accountable for theirs. If you try to blur that line, you’ll only be frustrated.\n\nCheck out Adam Grant’s Give and Take. Check out therapy to learn to establish healthy boundaries.",

You know you've reached the core belief when, once it's changed, the problem no longer exists. When fear is overcome, stress dissolves; and without stress, the symptoms lose their power source and begin to fade.\n\nSo, to answer your question — yes, it is absolutely possible to heal from traumas, panic disorders, and many other physical symptoms, with the right approach.

The issue is that the mind has its interpretation of it that it creates due to the nature of thinking, then attaches to thoughts about it as being the only thing there is, limiting perception to only that, creating a sense of lack.\n\nIt might help to understand that literally everything that is ever experienced is this presence. There is no outside to it. Even your thoughts and emotions are it, as well as all from the senses and everything else from the mind.\n\nYou can never experience anything other than presence.\n\nWhether it is noticed or not is often a matter of where the attention is.\n\nIt can be on something limited such as a thought/concept, where presence is less likely to be noticed, though it is not impossible.\n\nIt can be on experience as it simply is, where presence is more likely to be noticed. For example, on the experience of breathing, walking, or doing something, or anything else from the senses in this moment.\n\nIt can be allowed to zoom out and widen to include the entire field of awareness (aka the unified field of the five senses and the mind) where it is perhaps most likely to be noticed.\n\nThe presence is the presence of awareness in all of experience and if you are experiencing something, then there is presence right here and now.\n\nWe tend to look past our immediate experience when we search for presence, but anything that highlights immediate experience is likely to give a sense of presence. Especially if it is not overwhelming for the senses and allows space to reflect on this experience. Things that emulate the more harmonious aspects of nature while providing space and time to reflect may be more conventional examples. Something out of place might also create a sense of presence, especially if there is space around it; it will create presence because it will get attention and curiosity. It can be out of place in a way that creates a statement of some kind, that is not obvious and is open to interpretation, causing a person to pause and reflect.",

Sounds hard but when you start letting go of past trauma and old neediness like I did and you start putting yourself first and telling people no and loving on yourself first boundaries are a form of you loving yourself. I personally used to be a huge people pleaser and would do everything for anyone and would get mad I was never treated that way I healed that let go of stuff learned that was me being needy and manipulating people to love me and I just wanted me to love me and since I don't care if I get any I don't need it.

If mentally labeling is too hard, maybe whisper the labels until you're back on track Try to be as relaxed as possible relaxed about it, let the experience come to you.\n\nThis way there's no bullshitting yourself, you know your quality of presence is good when there's a consistent stream of labels, and if it's not there then it's easy to know what to strive for.\n\nYou can do many small 30 second or more 'micro-hits' of labeling your sensory experience during the day to aid your sitting practice too. Check out his YT channel and his free pdf '5 ways to know yourself' if you're interested. He's a great teacher.",

Being present and letting go is very important for me to navigate this situation. It's such a hard thing to have to constantly address it. It's exhausting.\nBut I have tiny moments of letting go of the decision. I need to work on it and try to have as much self compassion as I can",

    "text": "Been there, done that. You have fallen prey to idiot compassion, which is the near enemy of compassion. Compassion must include compassion toward yourself, first and foremost.\n\nI too have an over-giving nature by default, and I love to help others, but that comes at the cost of my currencies: time, focus, attention, presence, money, etc. With close friends and family members, and even with total strangers, I would give a lot, gladly, sometimes to my own detriment because I would notice that it was not reciprocated with the same energy and enthusiasm, and even strangers felt entitled to ask me for more than what I initially was giving gladly and freely. People would often tell me that they wouldn't have done what I did, and I merely chalked it up to them not knowing to \"pay things forward,\" but I had miscalculated.\n\nThe problem is that you, I, and others like us have done the same thing that the indigenous Caribbean people of the Americas did when the Spanish colonizers arrived from the Old World. (My family is originally from that region of the world, so when I realized the connection, everything clicked.) Visualize this:\n\nThe natives gave freely all that they had, including food, gold, clothing, shelter, and anything else that was asked of them. They treated the foreigners that arrived in amazing boats like esteemed guests, dear family, or even deities. The colonizers could not believe the treasures of this foreign land would be offered so freely. They were also put on a pedestal. So, the colonizers did not hesitate and took more and more, never satisfied, and then they pillaged, looted, and slaughtered. They enslaved and assaulted the survivors, and they destroyed many of the fertile lands after overworking the natives to death. They massacred the native children for fun and called it just and right and good and holy because they saw unbridled generosity as a weakness of naive and dull savages. And, the colonizers would laugh in disgust and say: \"They should have known better.\"\n\nThe fundamental problem here is that over-giving to those who do not mutually reciprocate signals to these others who do not value the same things, at least not currently, that you are prey and fresh meat. They will either consciously or subconsciously be driven to take advantage of you. Due to an over-giving nature, you will extend vulnerability to those close to you, and because you see their potential for kindness (because both extremes exist within all of us), you project your values and beliefs and nature and assumptions about yourself onto them, only to be sorely disappointed. \n\nIf they don't match you naturally and effortlessly, they are different and potentially misaligned, but because you love these people in your life, you may convince yourself that sacrifice and compromise is necessary for harmonious relationships. Yet, eventually, it all comes at your expense.\n\nSo, you blind yourself to them taking from you without giving even a tenth of what you generously offered back, and what little they do for you, they throw it in your face or call you a burden. They also take you for granted because you value presence and connection and solidarity, and a lot of it. You always gladly accommodate them, but accommodating you gets you called high-maintenance at best.\n\nAs such, you need to use discernment at all times. Place boundaries on YOURSELF. Raise the standard for what it takes for people to have access to you, your currencies, and your other resources. Place the focus on yourself, and only entertain versions of people who are equally invested in having consistent, reliable, and sustainable dynamics with you that are mutually satisfying and mutually reciprocal. Only these versions of people get to enjoy the full extent of your generosity. \n\nYour magnanimity will not be valued by those who are actively in colonizer mode. You need to set the example for how interactions with you need to go, and if the current versions of them cannot match what you offer in exchange, and there's no way to find alignment in a mutually satisfactory way that does not drain you further, it's best for you and/or them to walk away, at least for now. This version of them is incompatible with your true nature. You cannot entertain dynamics that drain you. It costs too much, and it leaves you empty.\n\nAt this point, start withdrawing from those who only take from the unfettered access to you and your resources. They value scarcity when you value abundance. Let them wake up and realize that there are consequences for simply taking. Do not bring it up in conversation, and merely say that you have been burning out and are taking time to focus on yourself. Cut ties from those who behave disrespectfully toward you when you have never addressed them in a foul way. \n\nNever wish them ill, and only wish them well. Incompatible versions of people can work themselves out without you being present. You need to be there for you now.\n\nFocus on your health, growing your wealth, forming new connections, gaining new skills for fun and for profit, and give generously on your own terms in ways that are sustainable. Spend time in nature, exercise, and meditate. Allow everything that doesn't serve you anymore to simply fall off you and fade away. Invest in yourself heavily and cultivate a strong relationship with yourself with encouraging and compassionate self-talk.\n\nThen, when you feel more at ease with yourself and this new path, join other groups and meet more and more people. Cast a wider net. Carefully vet and seek people who are currently compatible, and allow others from the past to catch up when they are ready, assuming that they are not in colonizer mode anymore. Actively weed out people who have switched over to taking advantage of you, and make sure that you check people are consistent and reliable and that it is not in their nature to take without the desire and commitment to reciprocate. \n\nOnce you have established a community and support system of others like you, and you have been prioritizing yourself, you will have replenished yourself. Then, your cup will start to overflow.",

He wasn't rich, but he had everything he needed: a cozy little house 🏡, an orchard full of life 🍎🌱 and friends who loved him dearly ❤️.\n\nOne day, a ghost 👻 who wandered the world, envious of his happiness 🌟, decided to put him to the test. He appeared one night surrounded by a spectral glow ✨ and said to him:\n\n\\-I will give you seven golden vessels 🏺✨, but there is a challenge: the last one is empty. \n\n*If you manage to fill it, you will be even happier.*\n\nThe man accepted and began to fill the seventh jar with gold coins 💰, jewels 💎 and everything valuable he could find. But, to his surprise, the jar was still empty. Soon, he sold his belongings 🛋️, worked tirelessly 🛠️ and stopped enjoying life 🌅.\n\nThe ghost, from the shadows 🕶️, laughed maliciously 😈, believing he had triumphed.

It’s hard to sell things to you when you have an abundant mindset. Everywhere you look in a capitalist world they are advertising different ‘problems’ you have and how the only way to solve the ‘problem’ is to buy their product. And what makes it even worse is that a lot of the time the ‘problem’ you are trying to fix was created due to capitalism in the first place. Capitalism poisons you and then sells you the antidote.",

There is a very good book called The Psychology of Money which deals with issues like our attitude towards money. May be a useful read. \n\nYou may have grown in a loving family but if your parents also had a similar mindset it may impact things - even if there was uncertainty about whether the mortgage could have been paid or the job was secure. Or the economic environment was uncertain. Lots of people who grew up in Eastern Europe at the end of the 80s/90s experienced this.

What you are describing is a common side effect of trauma, and what’s happening now is that you’ve reached a point of healing where you can see what’s been going on.\n\nThe voice that has been telling you you are gross, dumb, boring etc, is your inner critic, and it’s created from the things people have said to you in the past. Slowly over time, their voices have become your voice. This happens to all of us with trauma.\n\nThe fact you say it’s been 9 years since you’ve been yourself is telling. Whatever happened 9 years ago, caused you to change how you were to protect yourself. Even that inner critic, in a perverse sort of way, has been telling you those horrible things because at some level, you blame yourself for what happened.\n\nNow you have to forgive yourself, find yourself, and reclaim your self.\n\nIt can be a truly liberating experience.\n\nExplore mindfulness further, but also authenticity. Look into identifying your core values, read a bit about existentialism, and improve the way you talk to yourself. Instead of criticising yourself, practise talking to yourself with compassion.

    "text": "Another book that may or may not apply is Running on Empty by Jonice Webb. There she talks about childhood emotional neglect where people who thought they had wonderful childhoods may discover that they were emotionally neglected (with lots of the consequences of that).  The book is not intent on making everyone a victim and does not blame parents and may not be at all relevant in your case but lots of the things we experience as adults are imprinted on us in childhood and we often don't think about emotional neglect (as opposed to physical and emotional abuse abuse or physical neglect). Sometimes the most permissive and caring parents may inadvertently hurt us thinking they are doing the right thing and/or because that is how they were advised at the time. \n\nWould love to hear your insights if you get any. \n\nGood luck being nicer to yourself :)",

This approach is more in line with what mindfulness is about, ultimately: instead of focusing on a specific thing, you allow any thoughts and feelings to happen. The difference to \"normal\" mind wandering is that you stay present, meaning you observe the thoughts and feelings and stay curious about what will happen if you don't follow the thoughts but just let them come and go. It's a bit hard to explain, but the advantage is that this way you have more things to observe. Everything else is the same as with the breathing exercises: your mind will wander, and when you notice that, you go back to observing what happens with your thoughts, without trying to stop or change them, but also without running after them. Again, don't overdo it. If you always push your boundaries just a bit but no further, you'll start getting better in a matter of days rather than months. Slowly, maybe... but, again, any little bit of progress matters and will add up. The less hard you are on yourself, the more effective your practice will be.\n\n\nLet me know how things work out for you. Don't worry if it's a bit weird and confusing at first. It will click at some point.",

And then it turns out that you're not your thoughts, not your feelings, not your memories, etc. etc. Ultimately only something completely intangible remains. As a result, the only answer I can give related to free will is \"I have no idea\", and I might add that at this point I don't even really care anymore.\n\n\nThat doesn't mean I've achieved the famous \"ego death\" that some people chase... it just means the question has stopped making sense to me, in the sense that no matter how I try to answer it, I never arrive at any conclusion. Ultimately, even if there's a way to perfectly predict everything I'll ever do (which might be one way of defining a lack of free will), still nobody knows how to do it, so the whole question is purely a thought experiment, and it's not a productive one if you ask me.",

    "text": "The stupidly simple answer is \"mindfulness\".\n\n\nIf your body seems to have trouble resting, chances are there's a lot of stuff inside you that you've never given the space to process.\n\n\nThe most likely type of response you'll get is tips for relaxation techniques. Now, those can certainly work. Let me tell you where that got me, though: over time I found it harder and harder to relax with \"techniques\", and all sorts of weird stress-related symptoms started popping up even though I didn't *feel* stressed. \n\n\nWhat I discovered eventually is that I'd been denying all of the feelings I'd been having that I didn't want. Nothing dramatic, even, just all the small things, such as unwelcome nervousness and tension. I \"did mindfulness\", by my own estimation, but what I really did was observe the feelings with an underlying tint of impatience and the hope that the feelings and sensations would go away already. \n\n\nWhat I've come to realize is that mindfulness really only does its magic if you see it as a way for the mind to *process* the stuff that comes up, and at its own pace... so if I feel tense or nervous, I'll let it happen because I know that trying to trick it into stopping is just a stopgap and won't really resolve anything for good. So, I'll let it do its thing without trying to control it but also without encouraging it, and without fixating on it. Initially that made it seem worse because it didn't resolve itself straight away and I had to spend a fair bit of time with it happening, and more stuff started coming up... but when I accepted that and let it do its thing, eventually certain bits of tension faded and did not come back. That's recurring tension I'd been trying to \"manage\" with various fancy techniques for *years*, and it only went away when I did absolutely nothing to make it happen. \n\n\nThere are many subtleties to mindfulness, I've found, so if there's anything else you're wondering about, let me know, I'll be happy to explain my take.",

    "text": "I think you might have, in your mind, turned \"being present\" into a caricature of itself, where it means something like \"there is no stuff from the past or the future ever\". Well, that's not how it works. That's the ideal, the thing you might chase but never fully achieve. There will always be things that pull you out of the present moment, because you're human.  That's the bare minimum you need to accept. \n\n\nAside from that, there's value in *not* being present. Immersion has its own benefits - different ones -, and if you were present at all times, those would be unavailable to you. \n\n\nNow, let's talk mindfulness. The core of mindfulness is letting the things in your mind happen, not trying to control them. From your description it sounds to me like you're actively trying to eliminate stuff from your mind, perhaps by focusing hard on something else or whatever. *That doesn't work.* It may *seem* like it's working for some time, but eventually it will always backfire and everything will start getting harder. Speaking from experience here. \n\n\nThe only way to really get there is to surrender control. If old feelings, thoughts, sensations come up, that's not a bad thing. It's not a good thing either... it just is. In mindfulness, your only goal is to let it happen and notice what happens if you don't engage with it in any way. Don't stop it, don't encourage it, don't judge it, don't treat it as truth or as lies. I like to think of it as echoes from the past, and I'll never know what's beyond the echo if I muddy things up by pretending the echo is something more than it is, or if I stick my fingers in my ears. \n\n\nThis won't always be smooth sailing - even if you're quite experienced already. I still get echoes from the past that bring up an extra layer of anxiety or \"meta-thoughts\". The same applies to those: just notice and let happen, don't control, don't follow, don't stop, don't argue. See what comes after. \n\n\nPS. I read between the lines a lot in order to write this response, because of course I don't know your background and level of experience. If any of this doesn't track with where you're at, let me know and I'll try and come up with something more relevant.",

Today, i haven't stopped talking with myself, and like, i'm used to hate being alone, or hate not distracting myself with something cause the voices in my head wouldn't stop berating me for EVERYTHING. But now, it felt like i was catching up with myself. Like:\n\n\n\"This is weird, i'm talking too much with myself, am i going crazy?\"\n\"It's fine, we are just catching up\"\n\"These people frowned at me while i passed by\"\n\"Who cares if they did. You don't look bad, keep moving\"\n\"I think my friends hate me\"\n\"You can't change the way people percive you. Is not your fault, and there's nothing you can do, so 🤷  They don't hate you btw. You need tangible proof for that. It's okay.\"\n\n\nIs weird. It dosen't feel uncomfortable, but, is like, i'm settling in my own skin? I'm feeling more stuff too. Today i ate some fries with ketchup, and it felt like i haven't eaten those in years. Even though i ate the same type of fries some weeks ago. I still got distracted with the talking, but, it didn’t... Hurt. It's weird being nice to myself. Like i even asked myself \"Do you want to do this?\" About the actions i took, and it surpised me, cause i never did that before. I just assumed what i had to do, and what i hadn't.\n\n\nMaybe i'm going insane or something. But i'm really happy. Really really happy.",

    "text": "Carefully laying out plans might be the end game (though I don't think it's always the best way of achieving something), but that doesn't mean you have to start doing that perfectly immediately. Someone who wants to work out physically doesn't start out by lifting a ton, either. \n\n\nIf your starting point is thinking the word \"change\", the smallest possible step is to think two words. After that, three. Can you see where I'm going with this? Even tiny steps will take you anywhere you like, eventually. \n\n\nAt some point you might start asking yourself: what's something small I can add to this attempt at more active thinking that might be useful? Not to stress out over finding a perfect answer. Do you ever idly wonder about something without really seriously trying to answer it? Sometimes that's enough to get new ideas. Maybe you'll figure that writing down ten words and drawing arrows between them might be useful. Maybe you'll get an idea that it will be helpful for change to imagine a movie script of someone who changes in the way you want. Maybe something different altogether. The thing is, sometimes trying out all kinds of funky ideas will lead you to discover ways of achieving goals that a carefully laid out plan would have never gotten you close to.\n\n\nPeople solve problems in very different ways. People do thinking in very different ways. If the way you've been trying to improve your thinking is difficult, maybe try out some other directions. Maybe that will eventually lead you to exactly the type of thinking you want... maybe it will even lead you to discover a way that works even better for you.",

Notice the \"a certain way\" -- not \"good\", \"bad\", or any other prejudiced adjective, but the neutral \"a certain way\".\n\nBecause what you seem to do is attach unnecessary labels to your thoughts, emotions, feelings, and other sensations in your body -- when all those things are, in fact, outside of any spectrum (are \"neutral\", for rhetorical purposes). They just physiologically occur. It's only your judgement that makes them \"good\", \"bad\", \"stupid\", you name it, and therefore makes you feel as though they're actually that. But they're not. Everything in the universe is inherently neutral \\[until you start judging\\].\n\nSo, make your life a little easier (and happier): instead of constantly judging your inner state, simply observe it from a neutral standpoint. Be aware of it. But don't be connected to it. Don't judge it. It's just there for your information. And what you do/don't do with that information is up to you.\n\nIf you properly apply this mindset, you can even enjoy the kind of states that you currently view as \"negative\". (They're not! :))\n\nWords, words, words... I can only hope that I was able to convey just enough to, at least, give you some food for thought. :)",

Same with emotional states -- there will be a difference, and the difference can hurt (what you \\*think\\* you ideally want vs what you actually get). One way to reduce/eliminate the hurt is to stop comparing different states in a discriminative manner.\n\nJust remember: no inner state is a bad state; there's no real basis to define a state as \"positive\" or \"negative\", or as anything else.\n\nI understand that these are just empty words for you, and embracing this mindset isn't easy and requires practice. As I said, I merely offered you a perspective on how to view yourself and your inner states, only for your consideration.\n\n(By the way, this approach presupposes a certain degree of freewill, whose existence \\[or lack thereof\\] I, ultimately, cannot be sure of).",

The more restless we are and the more we dance to the tune of seeking the next hit of pleasure in life (no matter the means), the more aversive we will be even to mild emotional discomforts. \n\nIt usually takes a lot of time and repetition for a person to begin to truly undo these deeply conditioned patterns. That's not to mean you won't feel benefits from the practice today even, but for extraordinary results you need to keep sitting and opening up to these feelings to the best of your ability, every day.\n\nIt's ok if you get identified and end up running away from it; it's the consistent attempts what truly makes a difference and make the practice eventually gain a lot of momentum down the line, allowing for breakthroughs.\n\nGood luck.",

There is no better time or opportunity than when you are uninvolved and don't have time committed to someone else, to learn them. What do you like to eat? How do you like your coffee? Are you a spiritual person? Do you enjoy time outdoors? Do you take care of yourself? Do you esteem yourself enough to take care of your own health? Are you conscientious about looking out for your own wellbeing? How can you expect anyone else to value you and esteem you, if you don't value and esteem yourself?

Do you have personal boundaries? Get out of your head and start listening to what your body is trying to tell you. Learning how to love and accept yourself and grounding through a daily practice of mindfulness is peace on earth. You don't have to be a victim or stuck.  When you are good with you, good things start to come to you. You get out of the universe what you put out in it. Best of luck on your journey 💕",

    "text": "I think a lot of our culture places too much emphasis on romantic love as the \"only\" source of meaningful emotional intimacy. Truth is that you can find a lot of beautiful emotional connection in close friendships too, and friendships tend to be easier to create than romantic love, since people have less colossal expectations of their friends, and friendship is less of a laundry list of a thousand things that need to be compatible (or, perhaps in healthier relationships, a lot of emotionally mature communication skills) in order to work. \n\nInvesting in filling your time with things you feel passionately about can also help you grow and feel fulfilled. Pick out some hobby or activity or volunteer group and invest in it, build up new skills, journal, exercise, travel, doesn't really matter what it is, but build a life you're proud of even when single. As a side benefit, people who are genuinely happy with their single lives tend to end up coming across as a lot more attractive than people who are miserable and think that romantic love is what'll fix things for them.\n\nLastly, the idea that you need to meet a certain level of attractiveness in order to be in a relationship is the toxic body image pressure that comes from society and media. If you set aside insecurity and confirmation bias and just pay attention when you go to the grocery store or restaurant, you'll see people of all conventional attractiveness (or unattractiveness) levels in relationships or married. The universe won't magically drop a relationship into your lap right this instant to make you feel validated, but it's also not going to deny you a relationship for the rest of your life just because you've been single for a long while.",

    "text": "I made a choice that was healthy and beneficial to me, by choosing to be alone.  It is the best decision of my life.  It was the first decision of my own that felt like it came from a place of response and choice instead of reaction, circumstance or fear.\n\n\nSomething that may help you if you try;\n\n\nDON'T SAY; \n\n\nI'm unattractive. \nI'm not smart.\nI have nothing going for me.\n\n\nDO TRY SAYING;\n\n\nI am perfect as I am.\nI am whole and complete. \nI am worthy of love. \nI am beautiful.\nI am brave. \nI am capable. \nI have everything to give. \nI am everything. \n\n\nYour mind is incredibly powerful and you will believe what you tell yourself.  So if you tell yourself negative things, guess what you'll believe?  And guess how you'll feel? \n\n\nYou have the power to change this. \n\n\nPlease forget everything sh*ty that anyone ever said to you and replace it with a narrative that is beneficial to you. \n\n\nPeople insult others by projection. They say the things that they believe about themselves and dump it onto others.  Then we start believing it about ourselves and repeating their narrative as our own.  It is debilitating. \n\n\nWhen I started to change my narrative, I felt like a fraud. I would laugh at myself when I'd say; I am worthy.  I did not believe it to be true.  I felt ridiculous. \n\n\nBut I kept at it and over time, I started to really see myself differently.  \n\n\nNow I absolutely believe the beautiful things I say to myself and someone would be lucky to receive my attention and my company.  This is a far cry from what I had been led to think and believe about myself.  \n\n\nYou CAN take control of your mind and CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE\n\n\nYou have nothing to lose by trying, but you will find that you have EVERYTHING to gain by trying. \n\n\nWhen you feel like things are at a halt and not changing as you desire, just remember that Rome wasn't built in a day and this time you are alone is your time to heal. \n\n\nIt's taken you a lifetime to believe negative things about yourself, so you must be patient and understand that it's going to take a little time to turn things around in the opposite direction. \n\n\nIt can feel lonely, I know (pets are great!) But when there's inner work to do, it really is more important than company.  Because if you do the inner work now, then you'll have the company that is genuinely worthy of your attention later, rather than just settling for anyone in leui of being alone.  You know that saying; you shouldn't drink poison just because you're thirsty?  This applies to the company we keep.  When we feel lonely it can easily turn into allowing negative people into our energy space.  This you will NOT allow once you learn to love yourself and that means that when you do meet people, you'll be selective and only let the right ones into your life. \n\n\nGood luck to you and please believe that you're never truly alone.  But you have to believe that the power to change and choose is yours.  Which it is.",

Have a strong rationale behind being alone, one that you truly believe and you know will not change.\n\nFor myself, I recognised women are only interested me in the short-term rather than long-term. Despite being physically attractive, signals for high socioeconomic status and financial stability were lacking, which are the things women want long-term. I’m very confident in wanting to live a simple life and having chosen a decent paying career that is meaningful to me, so I’ve been happy to prioritise this over a relationship. \n\nConsider what you’ve mentioned. Not smart or attractive you said. Are you sure it’s true and why? Can these things be changed? Are you actually genuinely happy not changing them?\n\nYou’ll find you can start making changes or you’ll be confident in accepting your reality once you’ve truly evaluated your situation.\n\n2. Time. Despite knowing the above I knew it would take me a couple of years to truly accept it. I kept reflecting, kept tripping up in dating and kept finding evidence that backed my thoughts. \n\n3. Practice mindfulness and meditation daily. It will help you be more accepting, though this may take some time and you’d want to make sure it’s done properly \n\n4. Work on yourself. Exercise, healthy eating, career improvement, spiritual development, etc. Helps to feel better, put your focus away from relationships and attract others more naturally",

Setting little reminders throughout the day on your phone is also helpful.\n\nYou mentioned you used to be very attentive in the past. How did your routine look like back then?

Thoughts are like guests visiting the mind from time to time. They come and go. To overcome thoughts, one has to constantly develop awareness, as this will watch over thoughts so that they hardly arise. Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements.

Reality can unfold in billions of different ways, why are you convinced it will unfold in this one specific way?\n\nMindfulness is the practice of being in the moment. The only thing any of us have is this current moment. We can be sure, with 100% certainty, that the moment right now, is happening right now. We cannot be sure about anything that happens after, so allowing ourselves to become so worried and anxious and consumed with that the future might possibly be is a fools errand.\n\nThe Buddha describes the root of suffering as attachment; we prefer reality to be a certain way and when it is not we suffer. If we can foster de-attachment, to break away from how we believe life and reality must unfold, then we can be free of suffering.",

    "text": "Hi\n\nThis probably isn’t the right sub but I work in mental health so will offer some advice for this really tricky and sensitive situation.\n\nSelf-harm isn’t really about inflicting the injury, it’s about emotional release, so long term the goal is to find ways to release emotion without self harm. Therapy is the right way to address this, as they’ll be able to learning new coping techniques, explore what’s making them feel the way they are, and reframe some of those experiences.\n\nWhen it comes to sharp objects, it’s a bit tricky. Obviously take away anything that can cause real damage, like razor blades, but locking down every sharp type item may feel controlling and embarrassing for her. This may end up having a worsening effect, as they’ll feel more emotion and become more secretive and clever about how they hide it from you. Instead of a prison environment, you want a safe and watchful one.\n\nGetting them to open up is a big goal and that can be hard with someone so young. Aim for opening the door to conversation, rather than demanding a confession.\n\nOptions could include things like:\n\n“I heard from school you’re having a rough time and I just wanted to check in and let you know you can tell me anything, I won’t judge you and will do all I can to help you.”\n\n“When things get overwhelming for you, it’s ok to talk to me (us), you’ll never be in trouble, we just want to be here for you.”\n\n“Bullying is really tough, you don’t have to go through it alone.”\n\nThis keeps the focus on her emotions and avoids making her feel bad or broken.\n\nThere are some alternatives, they don’t always work but it’s worth exploring them:\n\nHold ice until it melts.\n\nSnapping a rubber band on the wrist.\n\nPunching a pillow.\n\nMaybe an activity like martial arts could be something to explore too. It helps with managing emotions and build confidence, with a proven track record for kids who feel bullied.\n\nUltimately, this is about pent up emotions with no knowledge of how to manage and release them, so therapy is going to be the best option, and the sooner the better. There are therapists that specialise in this kind of thing, hopefully you can find one.\n\nI wish you all the best with it, feel free to ask any questions.",

    "text": "This is an incredibly tough subject to cover. I'm sorry you're going through this, and that your step daughter has found this coping mechanism.\n\n\nSometimes therapy can help, sometimes it doesn't. Asking this question in a mindfulness subreddit is interesting because I'd consider giving her the ability of minding her emotions could potentially help it long term.\n\n\nI'm no professional, but my first advice would be to check out her online presence. Often these actions are supported by someone or some community. If it's not a friend at school, it could be an online community (which can be particularly bad) pinpointing this can be very helpful.\n\n\nTalking to her could be good too, finding out if specific things are triggering these things, and helping with that. Education on the harm. \nThere are doctors that work with this specifically, I hope that the current situation is minor and just experimentation that can be curbed early.\n\n\nIt's very easy to hide this type of behavior if it continues, so youc might want to come up with a plan to communicate or even monitor without being too over bearing. Sometimes I wouldn't even notice it on an my intimate partner.\n\nOften it can accompany a bad body image, especially at this age where peers might be talking about beauty a lot. Be mindful of diet changes too. If it is a body image thing, helping the family have a healthier lifestyle could curb those feelings. Better Diet, exercise, and mindfulness. It can be hard to like yourself when you're constantly tempted and continuing behavior that keeps the same bad body image. We could all be a little healthier. I warn this because without proper education here too, self harm can become an eating disorder as well.\n\nBest of luck to you all",

    "text": "Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\n\nI think education around carbs and sugars can be quite confusing...  and the community of people who talk about \"cutting all sugars out to lose weight\" often miss the larger picture of health, and only know it as a hack to not be hungry.\n\n\nFruit sugars (when in fruit form) are much different from glucose and fructose, nothing inherently bad about them.\nAnd carbs are an important part of the diet. (Sorry keto community) Many people eat carbs freely for the heavy, satisfying feeling the provide. She may be missing this feeling too, which makes new coping behaviors arise as well\n\n\nYes carbs will rise blood glucose and can cause weight gain, but, when eaten intentionally, after a lot of vegetables and leafy greens, this aspect can be avoided.\n\n\nThe fibers from the leafy greens will coat the digestive tract and slow glucose uptake changing the insulin response. It's quite neat. Chinese medicine calls carbs like rice and bread \"main food\". Never eat main food without vegetables is the mantra. Perhaps this specific education could help her sense of guilt around carbs\n\n\nGoing back to your stepdaughter, cutting out carbs out can really change energy levels. She may find herself in more and more ketogenic states, which many people strive for during weight loss, but there's a lot of education that should go along with it. \n\n\nOne strange thing about ketogenic states is that once your body adjusts, you don't get the same highs and lows before from eating like you would with carbs and sugars from the insulin waves. I suspect this \"flatlining\" of emotion can also trigger behaviors to \"feel good\", since food is no longer playing that role, and there's a guilt associated with it. And at the same time the gut bacteria that liked sugar also get upset and cause depressive states because they're no longer being satisfied. \nEducation around how gut health completely changes emotion and day to day feeling of well being could also be helpful.",

Coming back to our true nature and authentic selves is a subtractive— not additive— process of shedding that bullshit. You are right that the practice is just remembering who we are and what we already know. \n\nMy practice is \"begin again\". Anytime I remember— anytime, anywhere— I simply \"begin again\" and come back to the present moment. Maybe the mindfulness only lasts for a few seconds at a time, but as soon as I remember, I just begin again. I like this practice because it removes the pressure of sitting on the cushion (though I do formal practice as well) and can be practiced 24/7 for the rest of your life. \n\nI also like to use sticky notes on my desk with winky faces.. something about the winky face grounds me..

Yoga with Adriene on YouTube has all sorts of practices including practices focused on stress. \n\n2. I’ve had to learn to accept that there are some days where my mind is just a lot busier. When I first started practicing mindfulness and meditating, I had this misconception that it was about stopping thought. But I found teachers who emphasized that thoughts aren’t a problem. They arise in the same space as all other sensations. On days when I’m stressed, I really *want* a quiet and peaceful mind. But this wanting is directly counterproductive and the harder I try to control them the more they happen. Paradoxically, when I allow the thoughts to come and go, that’s when my mind does start to calm down. Or at the very least I’m no longer distressed about the thoughts and I see them for what they are. \n\nTwo phrases I often repeat to myself when I realize I’ve gotten lost in thought: “Everything is allowed” - even thoughts. This helps me react less when I realize they’re on the surface. And “just begin again” - to refocus on open awareness. \n\nI also now think about high stress situations as a kind of “mindfulness alarm”. When I’m feeling distressed, it’s time to take a moment to recenter. That could be as simple as taking a few focused breaths and feeling into the rest of my body to get out of the thought loop. Or if I have the time it might mean going and meditating for awhile. \n\nAdyashanti and Henry Shukman are teachers who incorporate thoughts in a way that I’ve personally found very helpful.",

I feel reserved and it’s difficult to make an exchange with someone.  \n\nI’ve learned to rest and pull my energy inward more regularly, like daily instead of finding myself so drained I can’t cope.  \n\nAlso if you’re going down a laundry list of what you have to do, write it down.  Check off what you finished so you can rejoice in your accomplishments!  \n\nIf you are in a long term or ongoing project, break it down into pieces.

    "text": "That's the basic idea, yes.\n\nIn practice, this can be \"difficult\". Typically something like a burnout is quite complex: a lot of stuff has to have happened for that to become a thing, and while resolving a burnout there will be a tendency for the whole thing to have to peel away bit by bit and there's a decent chance that much of the stuff that happened before the burnout will make an appearance again. Here's a completely made up example.\n\nLet's say that, for some reason or another, I've come to feel like I have to prove my worth to others and myself, and as a result I spend a lot of time working and taking care of lots of different things, and I keep stressing out wondering if I'm doing enough and doing it well enough. Between feeling like I have to do all of that, and feeling like I might be doing it badly, there's a certain tension that makes me both want to do things and not do them, which creates a sense of internal conflict and struggle. As I keep going with this, chances are the sense of struggle will keep growing over time until both doing the work and not doing the work feels intolerable, and everything feels hard: doing things, not doing things. Eventually everything feels like it's exhausting.\n\nAt this point I might be so far removed from how it all started that I can't even tell anymore where the exhaustion is coming from. I might try to analyze what happened in an attempt to fix everything, but even if I do figure out that, logically, the thing I described above must be the reason things happened the way I did, that by itself doesn't really make a difference because it's more like a \"program\" that has built up out of chains of thoughts and feelings that I've \"learned\", and logic is sort of disconnected from that.\n\nSo, all I can do is work with what's there, the things that I can observe inside myself. Knowing that logic isn't going to magically unravel anything, I might observe the sensation of exhaustion, and I might notice the replay of thoughts about what that sensation means to me and how I feel about it. Now, these replayed thoughts and judgements are part of the \"program\", so if I put any stock in them, I'm just going to reinforce the program (a little bit at least... so even if I do it by accident it's not the end of the world). If, instead, I realize that these thoughts and judgements are part of the \"program\" and I don't need to do anything about them, then all I have to do is let them happen and be curious what will come after them.\n\nIf you do mindfulness \"right\" (which won't always work, but that's okay), then a sensation or a loop of thoughts and/or feelings will start to shift in some way, after maybe a minute or two. \"Shift\" could be all kinds of things. Maybe it will just fade. Maybe more thoughts about it will come up. Maybe new feelings will appear (or old ones come back). Maybe the sensation will change a little; maybe it will move, or grow stronger, or get a little weaker, or change into some different sensation. Maybe a bunch of thoughts that were kind of going in circles will fade, or change topics, or move on to a different aspect of the subject, or who knows what. Maybe some sort of realization will emerge. Tension might actually increase, or feel more noticeable than before, or spread or become more focused, or start pulsing or tingling or whatever.\n\nNone of these outcomes/changes are inherently better or worse. Ultimately, any layer of \"programming\" that you stop feeding, both with indulgence and with resistance, will start unravelling over time, and that opens up space for more layers to enter awareness. Sometimes it might take quite a while until you become aware of new things, and there's no way to speed it up that won't interfere with the overall process. You have to let everything happen at its own pace. Therapy can make a difference in how long it takes by bringing things into awareness sooner than they normally would, but it's sort of impossible to do this on your own, so if you're doing stuff by yourself, you have to accept that there will be times where nothing seems to be happening, and be okay with that, with the understanding that it will come eventually.\n\nThis can be particularly true in the beginning. For example, depression is often experienced by people as just... feeling nothing, including no motivation. When there seems to be nothing, mindfulness won't seem like it would be able to do anything. In reality, there's a lot of *something* buried underneath a bunch of programs that \"protect\" the person from all the bad feelings. These programs will be quite subtle, so initially if the person could even muster up the motivation to try mindfulness in the first place, it would take a decent amount of time until they actually became aware of small hints of things that are happening. Then, as they keep at it and manage to start unravelling those programs, the bad feelings from before would actually *come back*.\n\nIt can be similar at times even if there's no depression involved. Depending on which programs something has built up, they might be quite out of touch with certain aspects of their internal world, and it would take awareness of some fairly subtle things going on inside to start getting into that. But, once again, this can't be sped up or forced. Trying to focus harder on some subtleties that you assume are happening inside will mess with the whole process. So, if you're not aware of anything happening, you need to be okay with that and just keep being aware/present anyway, even if you notice nothing... and wait for your mind to naturally become better at noticing things that are too small right now.\n\nJust to illustrate the \"layers\" thing a little more: people are often judgemental with themselves when trying to be mindful. For example, going back to my made up example, I might feel bad about feeling exhausted, and be tempted to judge myself for the sensation of exhaustion (\"I'm a loser, this shouldn't be so hard\" etc.). If I've been thinking like this for a while, these kinds of thoughts will come up automatically, as a layer of thinking on top of the sensations. If I try to suppress these thoughts (they're judgemental so they're \"bad\", right?), that won't help with unravelling that layer. Instead, if I accept that these thoughts are coming up, and treat them as an old program or \"echoes from the past\", without trying to make them go away, they too will start to shift in some way, and it will open up space for more change to happen. Chances are that before the actual sensation of exhaustion disappears, first my judgement of the exhaustion will disappear. That might not seem like progress, but it is. At that point progress might seem to plateau for a while, and I won't be able to do anything about that... but, keeping at it anyway, eventually I'll start becoming aware of more things, or more shifts will start happening, and then that opens up new opportunities for things to change. And that's basically it.\n\nI hope this helps!",

What helps me is switching to really small, simple anchors.\n\nInstead of only focusing on breathing, I’ll pay attention to tiny things around me — the feeling of my feet on the floor, the way my coffee smells, or how the air feels on my skin. No pressure to \"clear my mind,\" just tiny sensory check-ins. It pulls me out of the chaos for a few seconds at a time.\n\nAnother thing that helps is using micro-mindfulness: just one mindful sip of water, one deep stretch, one slow blink. It sounds silly, but stacking tiny moments throughout the day adds up and keeps me from spinning out completely.\n\nYou don’t have to feel perfectly calm to be mindful.

The video got me through many nights of panic and I would just watch the drone with deep breaths and an ice pack or essential oils. I also have used the calm app for many years as well and have done guided meditation for sleep or just rain sounds. \n\nIf this is all new to her, I would go in if symptoms cannot be managed from home. Try a dark and calm space first with things that comfort her. Aroma therapy, foot or head massage, go for a walk, ice wrap on neck, lotion, or simply just hold her and help her get through each episode. I would have her reach out to a mental health line through a clinic of choice tomorrow so they can help form a treatment plan moving forward. Medications take time to work but there are also ones that can be given in the mean time as needed to get her through until the medication takes full effect sometimes up to 6 weeks. That being said, everyone’s body is different so just tell her to give herself grace while find what is the right fit for her. \n\nThey can also give feedback as to if inpatient is necessary or an outpatient program would be their recommendation. \n\nConsistency and communication are HUGE for getting on a good path to healing and a good treatment plan. Tell her it does get better and she will get through this!",

Essentially- an excessive worry loop that I fed with my own behaviors. \n\nBreaking or slowing down that worry loop was the key for me. I stopped all alcohol and caffeine and medication when I was in therapy. That helped, but ultimately it was changing my own worry loop that ended it. Best of luck to you! It can absolutely be done.

The human mind is like a sender/receiver satellite dish. Our thoughts/emotions are capable of being perceived and picked up by others. Similar to those times when you might be looking at an attractive person a distance away, and they then turn around and look straight at you. \n\n\nSimilar to receiving. Ever had moments where someone will walk into the room and it feels like there is a boost (or in unfortunate cases, void) in energy? \n\n\nChanging of mindset does require a little discipline/persistence, so when you feel yourself starting to feel that way about finding someone, you consciously 'snap' yourself out of it and focus on more positive/productive aspects of your life.

Tell them about yourself and your day too. Build a tower with rocks. Play with the fallen leaves. \n\nIf you're at a beach, do the same too, barefoot, dig your feet into them, play with the sand, add water, build a castle. Just like how you played when you were young. Dip your feet into the waves, throw shells back into the waters, feel the breeze, smell the salty water. :)",

Maybe you'd like to consider occasionally adding some kind of contemplation/reflection at the end of your sessions, making good use of your calm mind to actually begin changing your perception in daily life beyond just going in and out of pleasant states.\n\nLately for instance after the calming meditation, I've found it very fruitful to watch the changing nature of things in my own experience, and to also sometimes reflect on impermanence on a larger scale as well. Contemplating Impermanence is one of buddhism's 'three marks of existence' that brings relief and letting go when we see it.\n\nThat's only if you're interested in such things though, otherwise just keep enjoying the breath practice by itself.",

Unfortunately, I had a combination of neglect and abuse so I tend to repeat this pattern now that I am in charge of myself. \n\nA therapist helped me understand that I needed to sort of reparent myself for a while to make up for what I missed. So this means kind of creating a parent persona inside yourself and then being the kind of ideal parent who provides guidance with compassion. \n\nI needed to gently help myself through the day to eat healthy foods, wear the appropriate clothing for the weather, drink enough fluids, manage my activity and rest levels, get enough sleep, take baths regularly, etc. my parents didn’t really keep me to any schedule and the household was chaotic. I needed to create a restful environment free from chaos in my home and life. \n\nThen I realized these are little acts of self care and self love. When you meet your needs you realize that loving yourself means meeting all your daily needs even when you don’t feel great about yourself. I tended to fall into depression and neglect myself. But now I can show myself love by doing those daily things I so badly need. \n\nI think if you start to think about your needs and feelings, you might find what you’re looking for and hopefully you will treat yourself with love, gentle guidance and compassion as a loving parent would.",

I would ignore feelings that would interfere with a plan I had. I had these misguided notions of needing to help others at all costs, including my own discomfort. In time, this grew to make me miserable as I disliked always being there for everyone who asked, and also very exhausted. Later, this would turn to numbness and apathy.\n\nBut that is so many years ago. I have tried pleasing this body and listening to the emotions it has in more recent years. But it has not helped much at all. This is not related to my post, but it appears there is a lack of desire that exists. An absence. \n\nBut this was about trying to understand the statement \"you can never be happy until you love yourself\". Specifically, what does it mean to love yourself? And I emphasize that it's not that I dislike myself, it's that I have absolutely no feelings towards myself - and in fact the statement makes no sense to me.",

I don’t want to be too in your business or over-interpreting the question you’ve asked, but therapy can be a life saver, if that’s not already a journey you’re on.\n\nETA: thinking back, I recall how uncomfortable this was.

It started when I had my kid, and I didn’t know that it was a sign of “anxiety” for a few years.\n\nGoing for walks helped a lot.

I think that the issues that follow childhood abuse can be managed and improved, like any chronic illness or disease. I will share some concepts that have helped me, I’m not sure if they will help you but I hope they do. \n\nOk if you weren’t raised to feel then you may have subconsciously blocked and/or repressed your real feelings. Doing this over time means you don’t get in touch with what truly drives you. You don’t get to grow up exploring the world and fostering your passions like most parents encourage their children to do. So in essence you don’t get to know who you truly are or what you really want and need. \n\nThis leads to sort of a separation of self, and if you’ve been physically or sexually abused then your body and brain are super good at dissociating. And if you repress your feelings enough, you can kind of stop feeling. This could include not being able to feel love for yourself. It could also contribute to a lack of sense of self. For a long time, I felt like I was outside my body watching myself go through life. I felt like I was watching a movie of my life. \n\nI feel I am saying this very inarticulately but I think there are a couple things that could be contributing to your lack of emotions towards yourself. Either you are not in touch with your feelings due to conditioned repression, or you are so dissociated from your body that you can’t even feel it. I’m not an expert in any way, but having experienced both of these things, and seeing some similarities in your post compelled me to share. \n\nA couple of books really helped me get in touch with my trauma and my feelings and I can share those if you’re interested.",

    "text": "This is one of the most thoughtful reflections on self-perception I’ve seen. You’re asking a deeply philosophical and emotional question, and your examples make it clear you're trying to engage with this idea intellectually and honestly. So let’s talk about it in a grounded, human way—not abstract or mystical.\n\n**To love yourself doesn’t mean splitting into two people.** It’s not about \"liking yourself\" like you would like a friend. It’s more like how you *treat* yourself, especially when you’re struggling.\n\nLet’s try it like this:\n\nWhen someone you care about makes a mistake, is hurting, or fails at something—they don’t stop being worthy of kindness, right? You might say, “Yeah, you messed up, but I still care about you. You’re trying.” *Self-love* is applying that same grace inward instead of being neutral or indifferent.\n\nFrom your examples, you seem to approach yourself like a neutral observer, like you’re watching a character in a movie. That detachment can protect you from self-blame—but it might also block self-compassion. Loving yourself isn’t about saying “I’m amazing” all the time. It’s more like saying, “I’m still worth care, effort, and kindness even if I fall short.” It’s not duality—it’s about orientation.\n\nSo when your ex said “you’ll never be happy until you love yourself,” they probably meant: *you won’t feel secure or emotionally supported if the person you spend the most time with (yourself) doesn’t offer you care.* Not necessarily that you need warm fuzzy feelings about yourself—but that the way you respond to your own pain matters.\n\nIt’s less a feeling *about* yourself and more a feeling *for* yourself.",

    "text": "It depends on what you mean by \"caught up\".\n\nIf we interpret it as just getting dragged along by the feelings and associated thoughts on autopilot, that's not exactly harmful in itself. If you want to do it, don't let anyone stop you. However, I'd say that being mindful in a pleasant state actually enhances it, because you're much more aware of the feelings that way.\n\nI think the notion that getting caught up in a state is somehow superior to experiencing the same state in a mindful way might come from the misconception that mindfulness is about silence or about being totally detached from everything. I'd say almost the opposite is true: mindfulness is about fully experiencing things that come up. The only way in which you \"detach\" is that you don't actively reinforce anything that prolongs the experience beyond its natural span.\n\nWhy would you want to avoid prolonging a pleasant state? Well, as a state naturally wears off (which it always will), the way most people try and keep it going is by sort of forcing it, i.e. \"trying hard\", to some extent, to keep the feeling there. This, of course, adds a sense of internal struggle to the state (\"this is going away but I want it to stay\"), which can end up poisoning the state and \"teach\" the mind that the pleasant state is fleeting... and before you know it, the same state will start slipping through your fingers faster the more you try to hold onto it.\n\nAs long as you can stay in a pleasant state without any use of \"force\" (for lack of a better word), there's nothing wrong with staying in it (though this can totally be overdone, too, if you end up staying in a blissed out state and forgetting about everything else). You just have to be careful to not accidentally turn this into a coping device for other more negative things you might be struggling with, because then, once again, you'll start chasing the positive states and that will take up a lot of energy and tend to make it harder and harder to experience them.\n\nAnother thing that might make it a bad idea to focus too much on pleasant states is that sometimes we'll feel good for the wrong reasons (in a manner of speaking). For instance, if I've learned to feel good about avoiding things that need doing, I might get into pleasant states, but that's not going to help me get those things done. In that case, I want to observe the state all the way to its conclusion and see what comes after, and what comes after that, until there's nothing left that's getting in the way of me getting things done. (Experience says that's not always the immediate outcome, but over time that's how to get there.)",

Mindfulness isn't about ignoring or denying the things that are there. To the extent that you're not doing either of those with your body, \"letting go\" is totally a worthwhile thing, but no further than that.\n\nAs for what problems and sufferings are caused by: attachment. Be it to the body, to certain thoughts, emotions, sensations... any of those. The body isn't a privileged source of suffering. In fact if we're being very technical, attachment happens inside the mind, so all suffering comes from the mind.",

Depending on how you defined relationship with your body, this state of being may be very different from peaceful - you could be critical of it, or worried about it, or feeling like you have no control over it etc. and it could feel like state of despair when you think of your body.

For her there was one truth and one person to blame, and that was me. \n\nThe difficult part of having a parent with this disorder is that our voice is never heard, our memories are questions, our truth is not validate. For example she would say something mean, and if (If i had the courage and strength) I would say, well that wasn't very nice it hurt my feelings, she would say \" I never said that\", \"but mom you just did i heard it\" \" no i never said that, your crazy\". \n\nIt dest6roys our confidence, our trust in others and ourselves. \n\n  \nAnother part is the kind one moment, and cruel the next. When they are kind its because they want validation, \"see how nice I am\" , \"see what a good mom I am\" and when they are cruel its because they can't face what they did, so they become mean to shut us down. \n\nAs a teenager, it becomes extremely painful, because these are the years we are gaining individuality, but that is a big threat to a narcissistic parent. Some of us just go along not to take the backlash, and others of us rebel, cry scream, to which we are made to be the \"bad\" teenager. I hope this helps. Sending blessing.",

Mindfulness practices really help in becoming aware of our thoughts and feelings, creating that space to observe without judgment.

For those who often feel overwhelmed, tools like the Wellbands Reset Portal (https://www.wellbands.com/guide) offer a way to ease into that mindful space, even if you only have a few minutes to spare. It’s fascinating how something as simple as breathing in a particular rhythm can shift our emotional state. What methods do you all find helpful in maintaining that sense of peace?",

One may find it odd that I post questions here on Reddit, when I have asked the same to several professionals (psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists), but I simply have not had answers. No one seems to know what to do. There's no advice, no guides, and no strategy. And no meds that help. Literally my experience of therapy is \"talk about yourself\" and that is supposed to equal \"Get better\", but it changes nothing for me.\n\nSo I ask here on reddit because often those who have experienced are better at explaining and knowing than the so-called professional who have merely studied textbooks and not experienced it themselves.\n\nWhat you commented above is a theory that I've known for a long time. But knowing changes nothing. \"listening to my body\" doesn't change anything. I actually spent thousands of dollars last year in Somatic Experiencing, and still nothing came out of it. Even right now I am in therapy with a dissociation expert, but after more than 15 sessions, all they can tell me is that I have dissociation-like traits/symptoms. And no strategy where to go from here. For the record, I suspected I had DPDR 13 years ago today, and I've really put in effort to \"wake up\" and feel again. Sometimes I just tell myself that this idea that I have that there is more to life is simply wrong. And that life is just this.\n\nBut yes, please refer me any books that might have helped.",

That same ex-partner I mentioned also told me (at another time) \"fake it till you make it\", implying that if you try/pretend hard enough, you'll make it real eventually. This was in respect to being more present and noticing details in my life. And I did try for 2 weeks to just compliment things around me all the time, like \"The air is so wonderful and fresh today\" \"I'm so lucky to feel the warmth on my skin\" \"The city buildings are huge and amazing\". But after 2 weeks, it all still felt forced and I felt so exhausted/tired from the added effort of trying to be more present and observing/appreciating.\n\nI'm in therapy and have struggled identifying when feelings are \"real\". I'll be out with friends and seemingly have a good time - but am I though? It's not clear what having a good time really is; shouldn't the emotion be stronger than this, or am I expecting too much from life? And then there are times when I do feel strongly, and it's sooooo clear that I am feeling something. Like I genuinely laughed for the first time in years a month ago. If that had not happened, I may still today be thinking that I laugh all the time, when in truth it's not a deep/genuine laughter, but more of an auto-pilot.\n\nI wrote the previous paragraph not because I'm seeking therapy with you (this is the kind of stuff I talk about in therapy), but to highlight that I don't entirely know how to make something real. How to genuinely start having emotions for myself. I know you probably don't have answers for me; I was merely voicing some thoughts. Thank you. ⭐",

    "text": "No, you can't correlate the two without other factors. There's nothing inherently wrong with ruminating, it can solve problems. It's what our brain does. It's BUILT to identify and try to solve issues.\n\nMy suggestion would be to realize that some brains want to analyze. When it becomes a problem is when the brain can't recognize factors it can't control and tries to solve that problem.\n\nTo use a generic example, say I am upset about world famine. Perfectly normal problem to want to solve. I can get overwhelmed about the horrors of the world, but I have to ask myself: What about this can I control? I realize that I can't. I didn't create the problem, I'm not responsible for the problem. That IS a factor of narcissistic exposure - you might have been made responsible for everything, blamed for everything wrong.\n\nTake a step back and realize what you can or can't control, detach it from all the blame that might have been heaped on you and realize - it's not true. It was never true. Don't throw any more of your energy toward further victimizing yourself.\n\nI try to redirect to 'Okay, so what can I control?' \n\nI can always control whether or not I am supporting myself emotionally and intellectually, whether or not I am hydrated, eating well, being kind, being helpful. \n\nSo my solution to my rumination in this case might be \"I'm going to donate to World Central Kitchen and that's what I can do. I'm going to give what I can and then I'm going to do something to make my world better.\"\n\nThat might be rest, a good meal, some peace, a walk, whatever will recharge you. Wishing you well!\n\nYes, there's a lot of suffering, plenty of blame and horror. Be a force of serenity amid the awful and do your best to make your corner of the world - what you can control - better. If it is tough today, focus on what can make it better tomorrow (like limiting addictions, taking care of yourself, being kind, etc.)",

    "text": "Yes, intrusive thoughts can absolutely be a response to narcissistic abuse, especially if you’re someone who’s already sensitive or anxious by nature. Narcissistic abuse often involves manipulation, gaslighting, and invalidation, which can leave you constantly second-guessing yourself and stuck in cycles of rumination and self-doubt.\n\nWhat you’re describing—revisiting fears, perfectionism, and mental exhaustion—is a common trauma response. After narcissistic abuse, your mind may go into overdrive trying to protect you, scanning for danger or replaying past moments to “make sense” of them. That loop can feel intrusive and relentless.\n\nThis isn’t just a thinking problem—it’s an *emotional wound* that needs compassion, not just mental strategies. The goal isn’t to stop the thoughts immediately, but to start noticing the *tone* behind them. Is it fear? Guilt? Shame? Often, if you can meet the emotion behind the thought with kindness instead of control, the mental grip starts to loosen.\n\nYou’re not broken or failing for struggling with this. Healing from narcissistic abuse is deep work. Have you had a chance to explore this in trauma-informed therapy, or with resources on complex PTSD or emotional abuse recovery?",

    "text": "I definitely understand what you’re going through, from a personal perspective, and I just want you to know that you’re not alone by any means! As much as this may sound cliche, meditation was a game changer for me. I also have had those kinds of relationships, as well as from my own mother, and when starting my healing journey I thought there would be no end to the relentless thoughts, fears, and anxiety, but after looking more into spirituality, religion, and meditation I felt an immense shift from feeling so overtaken with those thoughts and feelings, to realizing they aren’t real. Meditation is something I still am trying to get down but each day I feel stronger control and connection to myself and the thoughts or fears slowly start to fade and not be so invasive. There is also a book by Eckhart Tolle called “Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose” that also helped a ton. I know this is a lot and may come off as silly or “woowoo” but for me it has been the only thing that has truly started to help. Good luck and I hope things get better for you soon! ✨",

    "text": "My solutions are about moving from rumination to redirection to positive action. Use your mind to formulate what to DO about it.\n\nWhen you look at it that way you're refocusing your efforts. Can you solve world hunger? Absolutely not. Can you do something small to help and express intent? Sure. But once that's done, then you move on to another subject about what to do.\n\nYou can't 'solve' certain or all problems using mind, but you can put problems into perspective by using the mind to develop strategies.\n\n\"If I'm thinking about something I can't control, I need to acknowledge that and either develop something to do or realize I'm wasting my effort.\"\n\nAnother good method would be to journal it. Set a timer. Give yourself half an hour to write down every single thing you're ruminating about. Reread. See how much repetition you've got going. Become aware of your habits and how much your effort might be repetitive/unproductive/destructive.\n\nThat's what mindfulness offers you - taking a step back and being aware of how much of your mind's work might be wasted or counterproductive. Then you can formulate strategies to redirect. Move from rumination to focused action toward your real goals.",

    "text": "You're already doing some amazing and courageous work—EMDR and somatic healing (especially based on *Letting Go*) are both powerful approaches. That kind of progress in just three months is no small thing.\n\nSince you're open to exploring more, here are a few ideas that might deepen your healing without overwhelming you:\n\n*  **Parts work (IFS – Internal Family Systems)**: This helps identify different “parts” of you (like the fearful child, the perfectionist, the protector) and builds compassion and balance between them. It can be incredibly soothing for people healing from narcissistic abuse.\n*  **Nervous system regulation practices**: You might already be doing some of this with somatic work, but things like gentle vagus nerve exercises, orienting, humming, or even slow rhythmic movement can calm those survival patterns when the intrusive thoughts spike.\n*  **Self-compassion meditations**: These can help shift your internal tone from control and judgment to warmth and acceptance—especially when your brain is stuck in rumination loops.\n*  **Journaling with curiosity**: When a thought feels intrusive, try asking: “What does this part of me believe it’s protecting me from?” or “What would this fear say if I let it speak for a minute, without pushing it away?”—not to agree with it, just to soften the fight.\n\nYou’re clearly already building emotional awareness and inner safety. That’s a big deal. Keep listening to your body and staying kind to yourself when it gets hard. This isn’t a linear path, but it *is* a real one.",

Once you find the cause of that fear, and in this case it may very well be the narcissist making you feel less than, you can then begin to let go of that fear. \n\nEvery time you react to something in a negative way because of that fear, you recognize it, and know that it’s not a true feeling, but a feeling you were traumatized into feeling. Then you are an observer of that emotion instead of the victim of that emotion. You decide to give it no power over you. You have to make that decision. \n\n\nIt’s not an easy thing. It’s not a simple one time decision. But each time it happens and you recognize it, take away its power over you in the moment, the next time it happens it will affect you less. Every time it happens it will be less and less until it goes away. \n\n\nIt will take time, but you are stronger than it and you will overcome it and you will feel amazing and powerful as you do.

That shift - from waiting for “me time” to recognizing this moment as already ours - is a quiet revolution.\n\nThe hardest part, I think, is dropping the belief that value only comes from rest or reward. Folding clothes can be a form of presence. A traffic jam can become a small retreat... if we stop resisting and just inhabit the moment.\n\nFor me, it's not about forcing gratitude or pretending every task is joyful. It’s about remembering that even the ordinary carries the imprint of my own life.   \nAnd like you said: this is it. Not someday. Not later. This.\n\nThanks for the reminder.

    "text": "Many things can get in the way, such as devices, thinking about the future or past, getting caught up in thoughts and drama, reading too much news and the residue that it can leave on the mind, getting stuck in Reddit main after logging out of Reddit and finding one has scrolled through that, often random nonsense, for longer than one would have liked instead of just closing the app/browser immediately, and so on.\n\nI will offer some solutions now as I see that as being important.\n\nAiming for mindful moments throughout the day, setting the intention to do that each day, even if the mindful moments are often short or parts of larger tasks or experiences. It keeps the practice alive and it allows it to develop naturally. Ceasing to engage in things that are clearly mindless activities as much as possible or practical is also important.\n\nThis means to experience what is now and do single tasking rather than multitasking. Observing the experience of what is occurring now, rather than thinking too much about what is coming next. Or if you are multitasking and it is necessary to some extent, limit what that includes as much as possible, so as not to overload the senses, distracting the mind as little as possible, just experience what is now, observe the experience of it as it is occurring in real time, do that from start to finish if possible, and do it gently and in a somewhat open way. You can slow down the activity a bit if it helps. You can also do the activity more carefully than you otherwise would, as this may help to encourage mindfulness.\n\nYou can either focus on the experience of the body, or do it in a more general way which is less limited to a single sense, or a more flowing way that allows the attention to move while you focus on the experience occurring now rather than the thoughts about it or the comparisons with it and other things. Just let the thoughts come and go and focus on the experience that is occurring now. It is even possible to observe the experience of thoughts, rather than seeing them as units of meaning, so it is worth experimenting with that sometimes, though it is perhaps easier to do it in sitting or lying meditation. Thoughts tend to dissolve pretty quickly when observing the experience of them, and tend to lose momentum, leaving a fairly clear mental space as a result. You let the thoughts occur, let them be, but observe the experience of them instead of responding to them. You might notice that they change and dissolve all on their own, and are self liberating in this way.\n\nYou can do mindfulness with longer activities, but often it is easier with shorter activities, or individual sections of longer activities. This could include walking from one place to another in a building or room, or from one place to another outside if walking, but not setting the goal for the entire journey, to make it more achievable. It could also include opening or closing a door or drawer, standing up or sitting down, moving a chair, taking a single mouthful of food then chewing it and swallowing it, and similar for a single sip of a drink. Many other possible things too, but choose things that work for you and that are achievable, then there is more chance of succeeding at this and gaining confidence as well as enjoying it, and you will likely start to notice other moments that you can practice mindfulness in too, adding to this naturally.\n\nSo, If you aim for individual mindful moments throughout the day, setting an achievable goal, then you might find yourself experiencing more of them over time as your confidence increases and you start to experience the benefits of it. Then after a while they may start stringing together and may at times become more like mindful living. It is easier said than done perhaps in the times that we live in, but it is something worth aiming for and attempting each day.",

    "text": "Progression in mindfulness hinges on being in wholesome states, states free from sensual desire, ill-will, doubt/perplexity, restlessness and worry, and dullness and drowsiness. You can reflect to see if this is true in your experience.\n\nAnd it is the cultivation of wholesome qualities that lead the mind to frequently abide in wholesome states. The Buddha described this as bhāvanā, where one abandons unwholesome qualities and cultivates wholesome qualities.\n\n* So abandoning killing of living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, use of false speech, or intoxicants that promote negligence can be the first stage of development.\n* Further, one can reflect on using well-spoken speech, i.e. avoid slandering, dividing people, speaking roughly or rudely or idle chatter. And instead speak what is true, at the proper time, gently, with a mind of loving-kindness, and only that which is beneficial. You can read more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WordsOfTheBuddha/comments/1d00bjs/five_factors_of_wellspoken_speech_an_5198/).\n   * Reflection: As you stop putting out harm in the world, you would notice that harm does not come back to you, allowing growth of wholesome qualities\n* Further, you can apply sense-restraint, i.e. avoid engaging in activities that prolong excitement, passion, lust, strong emotions from building in the mind. You can read more on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WordsOfTheBuddha/comments/1kc9t45/all_diversity_arises_dependent_on_elements_a_map/) to see the effects of doing this, basically it results in diverse fevers, passions, quests, and acquisitions, i.e. furthering of identity.\n* After this, you can practice moderation in eating.\n   * Reflection: Observe growth / decline of mindfulness in correlation to how eating is approach, when the mind is taking pleasure in eating v/s when there is eating only for continuation of life.\n* After this, you can train in wakefulness, where you do sitting and walking meditations spread through your day. At night before going to sleep, you can set an intent to wake up, as well as choose to sleep in lion's posture if that's comfortable.\n* Next, is the training in mindfulness. You may find [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WordsOfTheBuddha/comments/1gx873b/mindfulness_of_breathing_and_postures_from_mn_10/) helpful for breathing guidance. It has further links for the next steps of progression.\n\nI suggest reflecting on this as a broad map based on the Buddha's teaching framework. Further cultivation in the areas that you see having room for growth should lead to growth in mindfulness. Ideally, you would like to train in the sequence as presented above, as they go from covering gross mental qualities that prevent mindfulness altogether to then more refined qualities, and starting wakefulness training, now one is developing new wholesome qualities.\n\nDepending on where you're, this can take several months, a year, or two to get to training with full awareness and mindfulness. There is also a stage after this, where one trains in seclusion to cultivate jhānas, states of growing collectedness and unification of mind, where one experiences joy, contentment,  peacefulness, and equanimity at all times.",

    "text": "i started consistent body awareness based practice in '98. i was always more into physical sports/games etc before this too. Now after a lot of years of practice i can maintain a much fuller body awareness. In the daoist arts this is sometimes done through what can be called 'soaking the mind fluid into the body.' Also its part of a process of qi & awareness spreading through the body and penetrating to ever deeper levels, ideally on through to the brain tissue and bone marrow.\n\nthere is still a factor though where needing to do complex mental tasks can pull awareness and energy more to them. To counter this i slow tasks down as much as possible, to keep awareness in the body at the same time, as far as possible. So i even e.g. tend to always walk slower than most people and have a more deliberate walk, keeping awareness in the body as i go.",

My aunt adopted me and my 4sibs when i was 10. She was an abusive, gaslighting narcissist supreme.\n\n  My uncle would have been a good person / dad were it not for her, but she had control of him too. She was physically abusive to my younger sibs and emotionally abusive to me, telling me I was a wall flower & that i didn't get the good chest she got from our genes, etc... she literally would drive around to ensure my car was where I said I would be & storm into my friends houses accusing us of making pot brownies and such. She would walk into my classrooms to make sure I was wearing my glasses, etc. \nI tried to have a meeting with the family in my late 20's thinking we could be honest (dumb me) and i was gaslighted worse than probably ever before by both my aunt AND my uncle (which hurt most of all) -both of them saying I almost caused them to get divorced and them even taking credit for detoxing me from a very deep 1year addiction to uppers which was INSANE to me as i had never spent another night in that house after I left on my 18th bday....the gossip and lies that go around about me is so hurtful and crazy and I don't fight it or defend myself-instead I run.\n\nAnyway...I think about sending this whole post/thread to the group \"family\" chat I started a few years ago (I'm 45 now)...but I probably wouldn't even get a response. I still would like to just have them even read it anyway. \nIdk...I've been struggling with cutting them off completely, but at this point I think I'll probably just send 1 text around thankgiving every year ...or maybe new years day? Texting one large \"this is a once a year text to wish everyone happy holidays, bdays and just happiness and health all the days of the year since we are so far apart in so many ways and that doesnt look to be changing anytime soon\"....& maybe even say that I'm here still if anyone needs an organ or marrow or whatever that I'm a match for and can give? \nIt's a struggle and it's hard to let it go and put ourselves and our mental health first....I am working on it because I don't want the 2nd half of my life bogged down with the trauma of my formative years. \nBest of luck to all who are on similar journeys.

    "text": "I will give you three possible options to consider trying if you find them suitable, in no particular order, but the third one is the closest to practicing mindfulness. You don't need to do them all, but each one might help.\n\n1. You could look for a different job while you still can, like while things are still going relatively well and you can still use this job for a good or at least good-enough reference. Maybe consider a job type or employer that might be more suitable for you, more chilled out generally perhaps.\n2. You could consider what the things are that the main manager complains about, then visualize yourself doing it in the way that she wishes it to be done. Visualizing it a good number of times to create and train the habit, to the point where you will do it naturally and then you will not need to visualize that particular thing any more unless she complains again, in which case, you might need to reassess and repeat. This may allow you to quickly get to the point where she stops lecturing you or at least does it less, which might make your work hours less stressful, though of course there is no guarantee. It might sound a bit strange of a thing to do, but I have done this type of visualization based training with some things and at least proved to myself that it works. You relax for a while with eyes closed in an appropriate space at a time that works for you, like when lying in bed or sitting in your room, then imagine being in the situation, imagining it in a good amount of detail, and you imagine how you will correctly respond, and you repeat it, several times over, doing that for however many sessions you need to for it to train a habit. You use the mind as a training ground, because it actually is one. The more you think or imagine something, the more it trains it, making it more of a habit, which eventually becomes more like character, more likely to express as word and deed. It can work to one's advantage if one is aware of it and puts it to good use.\n3. Another thing is to learn to observe your own reactions to things. It is possible, with some practice, to observe the experience of your own reaction to something, allowing it to be as it is and change as it changes, but do that while setting the intention to not act out on it physically or verbally. You let it happen internally and you observe it until it passes naturally. When the mind goes to the thing triggering the reaction to fixate on that, or remember it to bring it up again that way, you turn the attention away from that and to the felt experience of the reaction itself as it is manifesting in the body as sensation, and experience that until it naturally passes. You experience this sensation collectively, but it could involve things like pressure, tension, the impulse to act, this type of thing and how it changes over time, as well as changes in things like breathing rate. You observe the experience of this until it naturally normalizes. This can over time decondition the tendency to react. It might take a while, but it is possible, at least it has worked for me with the things I have done it with, and tends to make one less reactive to other things too when you create the habit of doing this. Of course, there are things which require a response and sometimes it is an immediate response, but much of the time the reaction just makes life unpleasant for self and sometimes others and if the trigger for that reaction is somewhat inescapable, that is where this technique or something like it has its greatest value.",

What helped wasn’t fighting that fear—it was sitting with it.\n\nMindfulness taught me to **notice the fear without reacting**. I’d sit, breathe slowly, and scan my body: *“Okay, I feel tightness in my chest. I feel heat in my face.”* I’d name it, and most importantly—I’d **stop trying to fix it**. That created space.\n\nOver time, that space turned into presence. That presence brought safety. And from safety, my body stopped seeing arousal as danger. It’s been a gradual process, but I’m not fighting sensations anymore—I’m just feeling them.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to break down more steps or practices that helped.",

    "text": "basically yes. You become much more aware of your body, and then subtle body too. So you are less in your thoughts/head and have more of a body/spatial awareness. You don't necessarily know your facial expression, as you can't see it, but you can feel it and how relaxed/natural it is. Also the practice i did was ting and song - song is to consciously release (ting is to sense/know), so you condition your body to be much more released and open, and to automatically release tensions as they arise. \n\ncontrol and predict movements, yes. Although its not so much like a trained actor as the scene is always unknown. So more like a skateboarder exploring new territory, and adjusting a constant flow to the surroundings that arise.\n\nYes, the practice also builds a lot of energy as its part of the path of 'cultivating qi'. But it still takes a lot of energy too. For me this comes up most when i need to do new complex thinking tasks, and things can start to feel a bit like moving through treacle or getting stuck in mud, especially if there's time pressure too.\n\nOn a related note, i saw a documentary a long time ago about how much energy is needed to hold a conversation. Usually people will slow their walking, or stop if they need to talk at the same time. Also their situational awareness drops, and they can miss things happening around them (in the test they had a mascot in a costume run past them, but most people reported not seeing it, when engaged in conversation.)\n\nYes, e.g. in tai chi practice this is done to 'merge the yi with the body and qi'. There's some more on this here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6dZ8lgS2mE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6dZ8lgS2mE) . Then this can be applied in daily life too, and also becomes something of a trained quality, this is the idea of reaching a 'gong' in qi gong etc [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erFZQ-28y50&t=240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erFZQ-28y50&t=240)",

So in a way we're always moving towards *more* mindfulness.\n\nBut holding some artificial standard of '24/7' practice can sometimes be more harmful than helpful.

This book really helped me understand what I missed out on in childhood and how to manage the fall out. \n\n2. The Tao of Fully Feeling: Harvesting Forgiveness out of Blame also by Pete Walker. This book helped me get in touch with my feelings and move away from numbness and apathy. \n\n3. The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self by Alice Miller. This one is a short easy ready more intellectual and espouses that all children are essentially gifted but a lot of the time needs and wants of the parents supersede the development of the child. It helped me understand my inherent worth as a human being. \n\n4. Mothers Who Can’t Love: A Healing Guide for Daughters. This one is directed more towards daughters and addressing the mother wound, or the fallout of having been abused by one’s mother figure. I think this one helped me see how I was a victim as a child, how I could never have been responsible for my treatment, even tho I was blamed. This one helps shift the blame off of you and on to your parents, who were in charge and responsible at the time. \n\nAnyways I hope some of this helps you as it helped me. It also helped me a lot to explore areas that I’ve always been interested in but never got to participate in such as painting, dance, gardening, etc. You’re in charge of your life now, not your parents.

I was really uncomfortable with the feelings so I ran and ran from them for decades. \n\nI’m still really uncomfortable sitting with painful feelings and I think that’s why I didn’t allow myself to feel, and thus wasn’t able to process (or even admit to myself my trauma). I really wanted to be ‘fine’ but I was lying to and gaslighting myself, just like my family had done all those years back if I had an issue or concern. Unfortunately, we heart breakingly repeat our neglect and abuse as our parents conditioned us to. It takes enormous courage and strength to look at those feelings, look at the past and say ‘I’m not ok, and what happened was not ok’.",

In that, today I don't feel I had a bad past, and telling myself that I did and telling myself that it must be repressed feelings and seeing it as unjust - how do I know what is true? I feel like it's 2 narratives, one that I grew up believing (that it is 'fine' and normal) and another taught to me in therapy (emotional neglect). Why is one more true than another? At times it almost seems like a choice I need to make: Do I become the troubled child that grew up? Or do I remain disconnected from my past? Or am I the result of something else entirely, like untreated hypothyroidism? And does it matter - and if it does, to who?\n\nIf I had to say what I've attempted to do in these adult years, it was find \"truth\". Something that resonated, something that made me feel something. And none of the options I listed above seem true. Of course, then you get lost in the mind... wondering what is \"truth\", does such a thing exist? What if I cannot have truth? What if I am denying truth by questioning it? And all the mess associated with reality, manifestation, solipsism and whatnot.\n\nWhen did you \"know\"? Did it feel \"right\" or \"true\"? Or did you just give up and surrender to the idea which made it your reality? And is that what every one does?\n\nThis is going to sound nuts, but sometimes it's almost like if I believe the past isn't rigid. I can mold it to what I truly want it to be. And I don't understand why I would choose to have a past that scarred me. A past that traumatized me so much that it made me absent and dissociated and unable to feel. If I had to choose, why not choose a better past, that forged me into a warrior, to overcome all adversity and reach something beyond the self. If someone tells me \"you cannot choose your past\", then why do none of these ideas connect with me? sigh... always going in circles.",

Add a “but what do I know” at the end of your opinion or thought and recognize that indeed it may just be your opinion and not “truth.”  Stoicism teaches how to stand in relation to thought where you can see the merits of other side. So perhaps your situation is bad, but you can imagine a far worse situation and thus be less triggered.

When awareness becomes still enough, it sometimes slips through the veil of ordinary perception and touches a kind of timeless presence. The looping sensation, that eerie familiarity of a mental or energetic space, feels less like a malfunction and more like tuning into a fractal pattern of consciousness. From the perspective of pure awareness, everything that’s ever happened, is happening, or could happen exists in one unified field—so it makes sense that the mind might occasionally catch echoes of that timeless structure when it quiets down.\n\nFrom my experience, these loops aren't random—they’re more like reminders from infinite intelligence that all of reality is interconnected and preorchestrated. You're not going crazy; you're brushing against the architecture of something far vaster than thought. The repetition may just be your soul circling a truth it’s trying to fully digest. I’ve learned not to resist or interpret it too hard—just to surrender to the mystery, stay present, and trust that what I’m witnessing is sacred.

I used to have rigid opinions about everything—what was right, what was wrong, how things *should* be—and it felt like I had to constantly defend my reality. But over time, I realized that all those thoughts weren’t actually *me*. They were just echoes of conditioning, fear, and a deep desire for control. The moment I started sitting with awareness—not analyzing, not fixing, just watching—the mental rigidity began to dissolve. Thoughts still come, but they’re lighter now. They don’t stick. I don’t *have* to believe them. That shift didn’t happen through force, but through surrender—through realizing that peace is what’s left when we stop clinging to judgment.\n\nSpiritually, I began to see that the mind is like a lens, and the tighter I gripped it, the more distorted everything appeared. But pure awareness—what some might call God or infinite intelligence—has no opinions. It just *is*. When I touch that stillness even for a few seconds, I remember: I am not the storm. I am the sky it passes through. Peace of mind isn’t about silencing every thought—it’s about seeing them from a place so deep and spacious they lose their power. And with practice, that spaciousness starts to expand. Your mind doesn’t need to carry the world anymore. Let it rest. Let it float in the river of awareness. That’s where peace lives—and it’s been waiting for you all along.",

    "text": "No, I don’t think you’re going in circles I think your mind is constantly questioning. It is a beautiful thing that will drive you towards many discoveries, the inquisitive mind. \n\nMy reality occurred to me after I recalled the past. I had been numb for many years and telling myself that my childhood was normal. Having a child of my own brought back many memories. But after delving deeper into myself, a truth emerged. The truth was that my mother was a narcissist and my whole life had kind of been orchestrated by her needs. I recognized I had suffered many types of abuse and that I’d never been loved. At least not the way that I loved my own daughter. \n\nI continued trying to have a relationship with my family but after a couple of years I realized I needed to go no contact. This was because I would have terrible flashbacks whenever I would see family members. This would essentially result in mental/physical illness where I would not be functional for 1-2 weeks after seeing them. I was so angry. I was so sad. Everything I thought I knew was wrong, and somehow I’d known it all along. Idk if this is similar for you. I had to go no contact, and as a result have been able to feel peace for the first time in my life. I’ve been able to get to know myself, stripped of conditioning. \n\nThis is after exploring and treating the physical side of my symptoms. Physical symptoms plagued me way before the mental symptoms. These included brain fog, insomnia, chronic fatigue, and chronic pain. Initially I believed my symptoms due to stress and changed my diet & lifestyle completely. But the flashbacks continues. Now I recognize that the best thing for me a combo of diet, exercise, mediation/mindfulness and a few supplements. And also, no contact. Again, idk if any of this helps you but I hope it does.",

These 2 steps of noticing and releasing are seen as foundational aspects to progress, where each one leads to more of the other. I.e. we notice a tension, release it, then this opens the body more to notice more underlying/connected issues, and we continue the cycle. Overall this creates a quality in us called 'song', where our bodies become more open and fluid, and we eventually release tensions as they arise, and life gradually becomes less and less stressful, even as outside conditions change.",

Triggers often have fears behind them.\nFears are not here to make our lives miserable—they’re here to show us where we need to examine our belief system and uncover the missing piece of information that could transform fear into peace. (For example, loneliness can become aloneness—and from there, a graceful time with oneself.)\n\nThe fear behind loneliness is often linked to a fear of death or helplessness. Therapeutic methods can help map out these fears and trace them back to the root belief that prevents inner peace. This root is often buried in childhood memories, so working with the subconscious may be essential for uncovering and resolving it.",

Thoughts are like guests visiting the mind from time to time. They come and go.

Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements. Whenever you realize you've lost awareness, simply return to it. do it continuously and awareness will grow stronger and stronger, it will intercept thoughts and make them shorter and fewer. the mind will return to its natural state, which is clean, bright and peaceful. one can practice through out the day from the moment we wake up until falling asleep, while sitting, walking, eating, washing, etc. practice naturally, in a relaxed way, without tension, without concentrating or forcing attention.

You can feel lonely surrounded by people or feel a sense of connectedness in a room by yourself. It’s your perception more than anything.\n\ni am currently going through a sudden blindsided separation from someone I spent 7 mostly happy years with. There are moments I think I am totally alone and feel completely heartbroken. But then I take a walk in nature, put my hard over my heart, and remind myself that I am never truly alone. I am surrounded by divine love. Humans and non-human animals are all around us. Even if they don’t know us the way a close friend would, there are good people everywhere.\n\nwhen I really need to feel connection, I’ll volunteer, turn of YouTube, chat with a friend, cuddle my cat, even snuggle up with Reddit and a stuffed animal. \n\nYou aren’t alone. Even in feeling alone, there are millions of people feeling exactly like you. Take a deep breath and connect with them energetically.",

    "text": "I understand your question. Everybody talks about healing, embracing, but nobody really explains what the process looks like.\n\nFrom my experience:\n\nOur first impulse when we feel discomfort is to look for easy dopamine (podcasts, videogames, alcohol, parties...) But the subjacent issue won't go away just because we deny it.\n\nI felt very bad when a partner compared me to her exs. I said nothing because: a man of real value won't compare to others....  Well... Bullshit... I denied it for a long time, ended up in a very hard crisis for me.\n\nWhat was the healing process? I accepted that those words hurted me, badly. I accepted that I don't like to be compared. And I proceeded to put clear limits on what's acceptable and what's not for me in a relationship. By doing so, I got in touch with my value, so much that the emotional dependency I had, vanished and I no longer fear a break up. For me it would be simply one more step in life.\n\nPreviously I would panic at the mention of a break up. Today, I understand that my peace of mind is worth a lot more than a partner that doesn't respect my limits.\n\nListen to yourself, don't believe everything your head tells you. But look at it, look at those thoughts and identify your inner child wanting to be seen and heard, take care of that.\n\nHow? Do whatever you feel your inner child needs. Do you want to play in a playground? Go for it. Want an ice cream, take one. Be, for your inner child, the parent you wish you had.",

    "text": ">“Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.\" -Søren Kierkegaard\n\nLove this. Such a truth. \n\n>it was a humble cue for me to release whatever expectations ive been holding onto about myself, others, the world, and the future. it’s true, life really is about the journey itself as a process and not so much the particular destination(s) we’re all collectively killing ourselves over via burnout while trying to reach.\n\nThis is a profound realization that so many never reach. I’ve been realizing it and putting it into practice this entire year of turning 60. It’s been a hard year — this age — and with regret, depression, ‘if only’ thoughts, deep realization that I have more yesterdays than tomorrows. Just a year of mental angst. Add to this that I’ve struggled with anxiety, insomnia, complex stress and for years and years due to life events and manifestations of those. There’s always been something to navigate, something to solve, something to avoid, something to predict. It’s really mentally exhausting to live like this and in turn physically exhausting. \n\nAs I reach my 61st birthday, strong messengers (spiritual mainly) have exactly relayed to me in many ways OPs quote. It seems like all of the sudden I’m just willing to let things go now. It sounds so cliche but I’m just wanting days to unfold now and being more present and accepting of what presents itself. At work. In relationships. In family. In self. I have to let go of the grip of predicting, controlling, organizing because I have skills. And they will be there to deal with things as they arrive. \n\nLast night at mass it just hit me like a ton of bricks. Stop wishing things away. Stop wishing your life was different. This is the life God has given to me — my good health, kind neighbors, a career with good people, an old home that needs work, my little commuter car, my adult children nearby adulting like there’s no tomorrow, my 3 tiny grandchildren I get to see whenever I want. Sit back now and be thankful. And let it all go. This is your life.",

You’re young and I was young too like yourself, and I’ll tell you this when you stop looking outwards for happiness and instead look inwards for that happiness you’ll realize it’s easier than you might expect with time. But for that you need the mentality of getting better for yourself. Of trying even when it sucks and not giving up on being happy. If you like being sad and moping around then you’ll never leave that mentality, if you would sincerely prefer to be happy look for help and accept it. I hope things get better for you. You’re not alone AND you’re powerful for coming out and accepting you don’t like how you’re feeling. Now prove to yourself that you want to be better you got this 💪🏽",

    "text": "hey there, friend. sounds like you've endured a lot of suffering for a 15yo. my heart goes out to you.\n\n\\> What is happening to me? Why do i feel like this?\n\nFirst, I imagine you might be wondering if there's something wrong or broken about you. If so, it's understandable to ask this in order to make sense of the suffering. I don't know the details of all your circumstances but I want to offer a bit of reassurance that you're not \"broken\" and you're not alone in your suffering. We humans, all lifeforms really, are high adaptable. When we're brought up in environments that don't meet our needs for nurturing, safety, authenticity, empathy, meaning, etc., we find coping mechanisms to deal with the pain and get our needs met (numbing out, addiction, people-pleasing, dissociation, etc.). As I don't know the full context of your life, neither do you. There are things that have happened and are happening, to you, your family, and the larger society you live in. We are interconnected and your environment has a tremendous impact on your wellness. I hope the idea that your suffering isn't your fault opens the door for self-compassion. And (self-)compassion is your way out.\n\nIt's okay to have different interests than other people in your life. You sound pretty self-aware and I'm guessing probably more sensitive than the average person, so that makes sense. Life can be lonely until you find your people. When you do, you'll realize how special they are, and you as well.\n\nRe: wearing a mask... yeah that's going to be a lifelong journey, lol. Children are born completely authentic. They feel good, they laugh. They feel bad, they cry. Eventually though, our families and society condition us on what they find acceptable. In order to survive, we suppress our authenticity in exchange to stay alive. Again, this is adaptive behavior. Some are fortunate to grow up in families that support the child's authentic expression, others not so much. For the latter, they have to be strategic about how to get their needs met. It's tough to grow up like that, but those that can endure develop a resilience and care for others that is hard to come by otherwise.  \n  \nAt some point though, you'll need to learn to trust others. It'll feel scary as shit at first. You'll make mistakes, but you'll learn. Trust in your ability to survive and grow.  \n  \nSome resources that might help:  \n\\- Nonviolent Communication (book): Learn to see the world through the lens of needs  \n\\- Miranda Macpherson (one of my teachers): She went through a period of depression when she was 13 and was committed to adult psych. She ended up having an awakening there. You can listen to her story here  \n[https://mirandamacpherson.com/bio/](https://mirandamacpherson.com/bio/)  \n\\- Gabor Mate and parenting\n\nSending encouragement and care",

Your mind is engaging in an active process to determine that it is a tree, it just happens so fast that you don't recognize it. I know that this is true because when people take certain hallucinogens or when people have certain kinds of brain damage, their brain *doesn't* determine that it's a tree, which means that there was a whole process of the mind putting the pieces together and deciding that it's a tree. They might simply not recognize it as anything at all, or they might recognize it as a completely different object.\n\nEDIT: I thought of a better way to explain it.\n\nImagine a human eye sitting on a table. Now, imagine that it is somehow completely functional, but simply doesn't have a brain that it's connected to. This eye is producing sensory data, but there is nothing to interpret that data, so it's just creating meaningless electrical signals. That is what not having thoughts looks like.",

Its been a journey. \nI still feel out of place sometimes, but I'm better off just being me than I was a few years ago. Just find things that draw you in, like passions, and join some clubs/ activities /places that you enjoy. You might find people to relate to. \nChange is never an easy process. It was a slow one for my mental health. \nIf those friends are so draining, maybe try talking to them about it or telling them that you need some space and time for yourself. If they're good friends, they'll understand. If not, you should stop hanging out with them. \nWhile cutting people off may feel awful and lonely, it's better in the long run if you're not surrounded by the right people. Sometimes feeling lonely for a time is a good thing, even when it doesn't seem so. It's good to have the chance to improve in yourself and mental health. \nAlso, music can help too. I don't know what you like, but I like to listen to some things like; sleeping at last, hopecore, oneheart, or the erhu by Eliott Tordo. \nMusic really does wonders to the mind. \nEven simply creating simple good habits for yourself goes a long way, whether that be nutrition, sleep, or exercise. A simple walk helps to clear the mind as well. \nWhenever I'm feeling lonely or pointless, I try to give myself purpose. Sometimes I might help or be kind to someone else, cook, learn/discover something new(mainly with books), create something, watch a movie, videogames, read, exercise, music, writing, poetry, or just a hobby I like. Even just simply gazing at the sky, whether that's sunrise, cloud watching, sunset, or star gazing. Nature does wonders to us.",

Creating distance so that we can more clearly see our thoughts as separate from us, without judging or trying to push them away, can provide freedom from them. Eg. I have issues with rumination, and I'll get stuck in thought loops about how I'm going to be abandoned, or I'm unlovable, or incompetent. When those thoughts come up I try to recognize it, \"oh, I'm thinking ___,\" or \"ah, I'm feeling ___.\" Then I can be with those thoughts/feelings while recognizing that these thoughts are not true per se, they are a result of core wounds and past experiences, etc.",

It is MIND, Misery, Ignorance, Negativity and Desires. And where there's a piece of mind, there's no peace of mind. But when you eliminate the mind, then peace you will find. The body is something we cannot let go till the moment of death. We will have to be in the body, but we can still the mind and kill the mind and reach a state of consciousness. In the state of consciousness, we lock the mind and block the mind. We can activate the intellect and we can find peace. So peace is within. It's like a still lake, but the stillness is lost because of the ripples of toxic thoughts created by the mind. Therefore, don't try to let go of the body. Instead, let go of the mind.

And if you don't believe in the reality of something then it cannot harm you in the way it previously did, and states of suffering only get fabricated to a very limited extent.\n\nPractice is as much being free *despite* the illusory self being there, as being free *from* self in the meditation cushion.

Place your attention on the thought, treat it like it’s someone else’s voice, and you’ll notice it fizzle out. Mind goes quiet again. Wait for the next thought. There! And it’s gone, because you noticed it before it could take root. Mind goes quiet. Try to fully notice things, without labelling them in your mind. Notice this, notice that, oh a thought. Notice it and it fades away. Now instead of sitting, go about your day-to-day, but notice thoughts as they arise, while also noticing everything in and around you; your body, physical sensations, sights, sounds, the task at hand etc. Avoid labelling things as good or bad, this or that. Just notice. When speaking with someone, listen fully with all your attention, and don’t worry about what to say next. \n\nWith sustained practice, it becomes easier and easier to stop thoughts pulling you into their stream and away from the present moment. Not just thoughts, but emotions, feelings and impulses, too, which makes room for peace, love, quiet joy, equanimity. It makes the ‘everyday’ more enjoyable, because you’re anchored to the present, and not ruminating about past or future things.",

You have to make peace with it and be patient - what you resist persists!\n\nNumber 2: therapy - I know not everyone is lucky enough to get this but it’s worth the money ten-fold\n\nNumber 3:  meditation and mindfulness - I meditate every day ish and it’s helped me see my anxious thoughts and feelings in a healthier way\n\nNumber 4: sertraline. For a period of about 4 months i was on a 50mg dose of sertraline. Had terrible side effects to start but things started getting better to the point where i was no longer needing it and just sort of stopped.\n\nTLDR: drugs can help you break through a tough spot, but they’re no cure and other forms of ‘medicine’ are more important imo :)\n\nP.s sorry for the novel!",

The hand written notes really hit me. so simple, so human.\n\nFeeling lucky I crossed paths with it and get to be part of its journey. Can’t wait to pass it on.

    "text": "As a very anxious person, it’s been tremendously helpful for me. \n\nI do think there are a few key factors for why it’s helped me personally. \n\nFirst, I’ve been seeing a good therapist for awhile. Even though mindfulness/meditation has helped me manage the anxiety, addressing the root causes in talk therapy has also been a key factor. It seems to have a combo effect with mindfulness for me. \n\nThe second thing is finding the “right” teacher. I put that in quotes because I strongly believe this will be different for different people. I tried various mindfulness apps that never really helped me. In retrospect this was because the approaches used in those apps didn’t really work for me personally. \n\nThe “Waking Up” app is where things started to really change for me. It has content from many teachers who approach it from various angles and so I could try different approaches until something “clicked”. I think trying different approaches was also just helpful because it was like triangulating around the same concept and I got a deeper understanding as a result. \n\nIt’s not free, but they also offer sliding scale pricing based on what you can afford up to a full scholarship. I’m not affiliated in any way, just a very happy user. It’s also full of useful talks about a variety of topics that I’ve found very helpful. The content from Adyashanti is some of my favorite stuff, and they also have guided yoga nidra among many other things. \n\nLater I started using “The Way” app from Henry Shukman, a teacher I learned about from the Waking Up app, and that’s been another really useful exploration. \n\nThe main advice I’d offer is about mindset. Early on I approached this as “do mindfulness, get result”. But things really started shifting when I stopped looking at mindfulness in a transactional way and instead tried to look at mindfulness as a way of being. The benefits will follow, but the more you strive to gain those benefits, the less effective the practice will be. Paradoxically, letting go of expectations and goals is when things start really working.",

It is nothing but a bundle of toxic thoughts, MIND- Misery, Ignorance, Negativity and Desires. This mind makes us blind. It stops us from reaching that state of consciousness. The moment you become aware that the mind is at play, you should be able to still it and kill it. When you separate yourself from the mind, then you lock it and you block it. You establish yourself in consciousness and you activate the intellect. When you activate the intellect, you discriminate and you do not let the mind continue to have thoughts that pour like rain, and push you down the drain, making you miserable again and again. So, do not struggle. Just be established, be locked in consciousness, in mindfulness, and do not allow the mind to enter.",

    "text": "If we want to have progress in mindfulness, if we want to go beyond focusing on the breath or on any simple method, we need, what is called, the realization of truth. When there is realization, then we are locked, we are established in SatChitAnanda. Sat means truth, Chit means consciousness, Anand means bliss. We experience that state of eternal bliss as we live a life of truth consciousness. But as long as we are practicing some kind of meditation, some kind of breathing techniques, all these are temporary, and as soon as we stop them, the mind will return, a mind we cannot find. But when we come to the realization that there is no mind, when we realize we are Divine manifestations, then there are realizations which eliminate the mind, enlighten the ego and give us eternal mindfulness, consciousness.",

    "text": "This is a topic I’ve focused on for quite a while and actually I credit hatha yoga practices in teaching me how to use my breath in many different ways. I practiced 4-5 days a week for years in a studio environment (now at home and since Covid and turning 60). So engrained are the teachings of yoga breathing that I find myself automatically using techniques throughout my day without conscience thought — entering a stressful meeting at work; wandering mind; hiking; taking a phone call from a distraught person; stretching throughout a workday where I sit alot; commuting and crazy traffic.\n\nA great book on the subject is James Nestor’s ‘Breath’. \n\n>There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.\n\n>Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren’t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of São Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.\n\n>Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is.",

I’d counter that it represents who you are at the moment, and is important to ground and focus you. \n\nYou are, over your lifespan, what you decide to become. \n\nHaving thoughts is critical. Reasoning is our highest function. It seems so obvious to me that of course we would all aspire to have thoughts, and to grow as we age so that the quality of our thoughts, and their resonance with our core values, improves over time.\n\nWhat people mean when they say ‘you are not your inner voice’ is that you are not bound to it or necessarily anchored by it for your entire life. You have choices. If your inner voice is compassionate and represents your best self, lean into it. But if your inner voice is (for instance) impulsive or intrusive or negative, then take comfort from knowing that you can change it.\n\nThat change requires focus and effort. Over time we can all become our best selves. Just realize that you have the power to influence who you become.",

I think it’s important to think about how much adhd diagnoses have changed in the last 10/20 years and that there is a lot more info availability right now then there used to be. Also, if they do have undiagnosed stuff of there own they are probably struggling to understand what the problem really is if they have made it this far in life. They are probably masking and coping to such an extent that they aren’t really even aware of how much energy they put in to it. In the old days people just believed that is how they are, end or story. I have a similar thing with my own parents, it’s very difficult to talk about because we have very different education about it. As for the food thing, idk, this makes me think it might just be time to move out, maybe the whole situation could be helped with some distance?",

    "text": "There’s a few things you could think about.\n\nOne is that we can only take accountability for ourselves. It can be hard to watch people make choices we don’t agree with, but ultimately we have to respect that others make their own decisions. The best thing you can do is focus on yourself. You can lead by example and you can be available if people reach out, but unsolicited advice is rarely welcome, and like you, your parents are sovereign people accountable for making their own decisions.\n\nAnother thing you might think about is therapy. You have your own journey of discovery, but a therapist can also be a great sounding board for helping you see the perspective of what others might be going through. Talking to a therapist about your relationship with your parents might help you cope better, and become more sympathetic and compassionate to what they are going through.\n\nYou could think about things like metta meditation or simply practicing compassion for your parents. They didn’t have the benefit of growing up in a world where these things are discussed and understood, and so have a lifetime of awareness that is different than your own.\n\nFinally, practicing healthy boundaries. Therapy can really help with this. There’s a skill in having conversations in which you take ownership of the problem from *your* perspective without telling them what *they’re* doing wrong or what *they* need to change. As you become more skillful at articulating what *you* need and supporting open communication and trust, you’ll start to have more productive discussions and help shift the needle. For instance, if groceries and shopping are an issue, have you approached it from the perspective of a family grocery and shopping plan?",

You could make it your life’s mission to become the kindest, wisest, most patient and compassionate version of yourself, which would allow you to reduce the suffering of people around you (and thereby, help yourself also).\n\nIf you’re wondering how to avoid comparison generally, you need to reconfigure the grounds upon which you are determining these people are ‘better’ or ‘worse’.\n\nThey’re wealthier? Better dressed or better looking? Have a bigger house? Travel more? So what. What’s their *character* like - how do they treat other people? That’s the only metric to go by. If they seem ‘good’ by that metric, well then, what’s the problem? More good people is better for the world. If they seem ‘bad’? Well, then they don’t have the internal landscape that *you* have; the moral framework, the kindness, the sense of compassion. And therefore they’re deserving of your pity, not your derision.",

There is some feeling of not being “good enough” likely at the base of it; a fear of what it will mean if others are “better” than you. \n\nWith any issue like this the best place to start is seeking out the root of it. It’s just a mental formation and a thought habit borne of it. Meditate on it. Consider when it seemed to have begun. Consider what tends to trigger this thinking. It is a reaction to some trigger or stressor. Once you can begin to watch your mind as a process and see how these thoughts are just a link in a chain you will be more able to address the root cause. Just trying to suppress what is only a symptom of a deeper way of thinking will not be very effective and may make it worse as well as bring feelings of shame and failure.

Are your thoughts going haywire if you don't shakle yourself to your breath. Probably do. And that's ok. It's\"normal\".\n\nThis meditation is for the birds, forgive me for saying that. Unfortunately that's how the Sam Harris of the world may try to introduce you to meditation world. It's ok, you have to start somewhere. \n\nBut now that you were kind enough to share, may I respectfully introduce you to the real meditation, Dhyana as they call it in the old country. It can be 100 different types of practices, some even related to breath. But hear me out it's very subtle.\n\nYour breath may be an anchor, but an anchor to what? If you shackle yourself to your breath but you desire liberation, you've enslaved yourself and it might take years to get to the realization \"WTF am I doing\".\n\nFind out who is it that wants liberation. You can ask but the answer never comes. That's all you have to do - who wants to know. You cannot ask with your mind because your mind is finite and who you are is not. Now if that's gibberish to you, which it should be since we westerners are going into materialism hard right now, then toss this until life invariably brings you back to this. \n\nWhen you anchor to breath you can more easily see that you can watch your thoughts come and go. If you are not your thoughts but the watcher of your thoughts, then who is this watcher? \n\nKeep the watcher close to you at all times. That is the doorway to the source of all wisdom. That is also the real you that never left you even as your body and your mind changed from childhood till now. Cheers fam!",

It used to be said in US homes, “think of all the poor children in China” to encourage children to eat their food (never made it taste better). Now I am glad to be alive, glad to be born in a time of medicine and access to the wisdom of the ages, etc. The fact that I have a problem seems small in comparison to the good fortune that I enjoy. \n\nReframing is a great tool but it does sort of accept the premise that life is a spectrum from “good” to “bad” and we just need to change our perspective on where we fall on that spectrum. I think a smart Buddhist would say reframing is a bandaid and what one needs is to see the spectrum itself is an illusion. \n\nSorry for the diatribe but I’ve been mulling the topic of reframing vs just being for a little while now. 😀",

Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements.

    "text": "I had very high anxiety for the past few  months it was almost killing me\nExtremely negative thoughts my brain telling me all the horrible things that are going to happen and I had a horrible dreadful anxious knot in my stomach every morning (cortisol  maybe)\n\nIt has really eased down in the past few days I am PROUD of myself because I was like \"tehre's no sense in living like this \"\n\nHere is what helped\n1) I was able to bring myself to read Thich Nat Hanh's How to Relax (it's like 30 pages or so and it really changed my mood) (here he teaches some tricks to bring you quickly back to the moment try those the next day )\n\n2)I am very worried about something that I  am planning in the future. After reading How to Relax I wrote it down that I was ready to let it go and that it helped a lot. I will still try it but I don't think about it all the time. \n\n3) After Thich Nat Han I was able to read some normal books (which I hadn't been able to do in years)\n\n4) I told all my crazy worries to a friend (before I couldn't do it because I was so crazy I was embarrassed) and that was helpful. \n\nReading -- if you can start -- really helps. The thing about the \"spiral\" is that once your limbic system is activated it's very hard to shut it down. If you could shut it down for a few minutes then you can bring in the smart part of your brain which already knows that the negative thoughts never become true and your brain is just torturing you.\n\nI think \"How to Relax\" could be a good start. Just try to relax for half an hour or an hour if you can and from there you can go on. Until you turn it off it's impossible to come to the moment. \n\nSo for one hour for example set a goal (will read How to Relax will stop thinking about the thing that worries me for 20 minutes..etc will get  a massage) and if you can get a relaxed twenty or thirty minutes the next day try to bring it up.\n\nFor any book set a timer (set it to 15 minutes and make sure you read it till the end). Go for easy reads (Reading really brings down anxiety no matter what it is but now  we know that novels and fiction are better for the anxious brain).    \n\nOnce you learn to relax then it becomes easier and you can do it in a few days.",

I would say it came close to entering phobia territory, also called “death anxiety”, as it is a form of an anxiety disorder. I do want to be transparent though that I am on medication that is known to treat anxiety and OCD. This has helped tremendously with the obsessive thoughts.\n\nHowever.. medication is not the path for everyone. What helped me the most outside of medication was that sentiment exactly ^^^\n\nI realized I was doing nothing but self-sabotaging my will to live by obsessing about the reality of dying. Every second you ruminate on your fear of death is a second that you lose on appreciating your gift of life. Do you understand the astronomically small chance of you being alive RIGHT NOW. Of all of the billions of years that this universe has existed or will exist, you are literally here right. now. Like… think about that. That’s literally insane. Stop worrying about death and fucking appreciate that you have life at this very moment. Seriously. Think about it. It may change your perspective 💓💓💓",

    "text": "That's the way people tend to think about it, yeah. It presupposes that feelings need to be \"worked around\". However, anyone who is very accomplished with mindfulness can tell you that you get a more stable outcome when the feelings simply don't exist anymore.\n\nNow, of course you can't just wave a magic wand and let them disappear, but the practice of mindfulness, done correctly, \"starves\" the emotions of the food that keeps them alive. By not engaging with the emotions, not even to \"sort of want them gone\", they start fading over time. In their place will be something new... either more emotions, or just... nothing, which is also known as calm.\n\nThe common approach of trying to understand the cause of emotions will typically tend to fail to achieve this, because as long as you're looking for the cause of emotions, you're sort of believing in them and in the thoughts surrounding them, which keeps them alive. It's keeping this level of belief to the absolute minimum (e.g. \"these sensations and thoughts exist\", or maybe a bit more practical if you're not already very good at this, \"these feelings and thoughts are sort of echoes from the past, and all I have to do is let them go where they want to and see what's beyond\") that allows things to transform.\n\nMore misguided approaches to mindfulness that try to reach an analytical understanding, or try to \"make thoughts and feelings go away\", might *seem* to succeed by painting a layer of \"everything's fine here\" on top of the feelings and thoughts, but other effects (tension, stress levels, blood pressure etc.) might remain. At least that's been my experience.\n\nI do understand your hesitation, though. It's only reasonable to be worried that if you truly let the feelings and thoughts run rampant, things might spiral out of control, if they have in the past. And yet, the only way to get true control is to let go. But that doesn't mean you have to do it all at once. You don't have to start by deciding to expose yourself to a feeling-laden situation and then brave the storm.\n\nYou can start by putting yourself in a safe spot and recalling a time when you felt one of those difficult emotions but to an extent that you could still sort of handle, and get into that memory far enough that the emotion comes up at least a bit... and then make no attempt to analyze it, change it, stop it, push it away, embrace it, focus on it, ignore it, etc. All you have to do is observe what it does, and how it changes, and where it leads to (with no particular expectation of where that's going to be). If things start getting slightly overwhelming (push only a little bit beyond your comfort zone!), you can still stop by pulling yourself out of the memory and doing something completely different as a distraction... even if you can only do a few seconds at a time, that's still practice and it still counts. As it gets easier over time, you can start recalling slightly more difficult situations... at some point maybe you'll even come up with a real situation you can put yourself into where you think that you might be capable of handling it.",

    "text": "notice that death is an inevitable part of life. Two ends of the same stick. It happens at every moment, but we fail to notice it. Instead of having aversion to death why dont you approach it with an open curiosity.What actually dies? can we ever know what happens at death? can we create tiny litle moments of death at every moment of our life like letting go of thoughts that are unconducive to peace? \n\nDeath has always facinated me as i had many family members die in a relatively short space of time. I started to see it everywhere. In a sunset, the ending of a good meal, spring flowering plants giving way to summer flowering plants, the ending of a movie, the changing of one mood for another. In a way these are all subtle deaths but really what i discovered was that  they are actually subtle momentary changes. We are living in a world that is constantly changing, there is no death per se but ever changing flux. Death is a dualistic projection we put on objects that are never fixed. If they were fixed they wouldn't be subject to change and life wouldn't be possible.",

    "text": "Yes, but not in the way some say it can. This is all my opinion, and anecdotal based on my own lived experience of anxiety.\n\nNewcomers to meditation can fall under the impression that meditation is about stopping thought - \"breathe slowly, and clear the mind of all thought\". Some further down the line will correct this point of view, and say that meditation isn't about 'stopping thought', but is instead about 'observing thought without attaching meaning to thought'. This is correct in a nutshell, but it doesn't really talk about how.\n\nThe mind produces thoughts. That's what mind does. Just like the heart beats, the lungs breathe and the stomach digests food, the mind produces thought. This is an inevitable part of being alive. There's nothing we can do to 'clear the mind of all thought'. But as the second approach I mentioned says, there is scope to still have thought, without also having meaning, story, and any other visceral reaction to them. \n\nIn my opinion, anxiety is caused by a compulsion to accept all thoughts as facts that need our attention. While not random, our thoughts are not always helpful either. \n\nHave you noticed that there's a space between a thought arising and you reacting to it? That place is what I call the impulse. We have a thought, and there's an impulse to connect with that thought. This is where the heart of anxiety lies. We don't see the impulse. We just blindly follow the urge contained within the impulse, and jump straight from 'having a thought about xyz' to 'xyz is going to happen and it will be terrifying and no way in the world will I be able to cope when it does'. \n\nThe impulse is that little moment in between a trigger and a reaction. Like striking a lighter. There is a moment between the sparks flying and the flame igniting. The impulse happens after \"I have had a thought about xyz\". Personally, I often feel the impulse as a body sensation - a tensing, a bracing, a 'sitting on edge', a desire to raise my shoulders... But I've been working with the impulse recently, and seeing what happens when I simply notice the impulse, and relax around it. \n\nWhat that does is sever the connection between the thought (which arose because it just did) and me buying into the story. \n\nIt takes a lot of work to do this, and you have to be able to see the process in steps. But like I say, this is where I believe anxiety is a compulsion of blindly following the impulse between thought and catastrophe, without questioning whether the impulse itself may actually be the heart of the solution.",

Whether or not they wanna work on their mental health is their business and all you can do is provide a structure they can understand and respect, and rely on, or they might reject it and leave you. If they continue to act like children , personally I would disown them, or distance myself to avoid that behavior as any normal adult would. someone else can deal with their dysfunction until they are ready to deal with it.",

So this critique of him is not pure as he thinks the western in essence wishes to aim toward the same as the true mindfulness.\n\nIn reality, the true mindfulness is somehow so ungraspable for most everyday liver that the collective energies made it into a form of \"easing up the attachment toward our created things\" practice from what mindfulness is, what is a form of \"I am full, i am complete, i am here, i feel this, i am\" practice. In their essence, the western created aims to a less advanced, very important focus point what is required to get into mindfulness. So although i agree with his critique, as i am to show, yet it is kinda miss-targeted.\n\nThis practice is good. Many people should do it. The problem lies in the perception about it, not in the practice itself.\n\nRemoving the belief of doing mindfulness, letting our mind to practice with our aim, and if people do what Ajahn Sona says, it is good.\n\nAll what i said was meant if the practices are theoretically being done purely.\n\nFirst paragraph is rather correct and high quality observasion and pulling of something lower, correctly and toward its roots.  \nWhat Ajahn misses is it is more of an other system, a sub-system of what he practices. Pointing it out is ather moral, for the practicers should know what they actually do and what they call it. While the actual description is also rather correct. The limitations and possible negative deviation is greater in what the \"western\" has doing, and in reality too it is doing horribly, farm from its true form, practices of most people include great part of unhealthiness training, working against their nature. While its source is of a higher level practice, where it offer some sort of truth, what he describes as ecstatic and blissful. Which truth also offer solution to pain and actually everything else what the western distorted version could aim as it is a tiny part of the truth the form Ajahn practices.\n\n2nd paragraph, not much to critique, it is almost entirely correct and in essence it is purely correct.\n\n3rd, a good advise. Expecting more than what a someone before finding anything from such nature is anyhow a granted positive dissapointment, so expecting more is just a helpful view not to delusion ourselves of finding it before actually finding, while not being satisfied with less advice is doubling it down, strengthening the aim and willingness to actually choose the greater truth and don't practice trash. Respect yourself.  \nPreliminary joy is part of what he teaches, yea that checks out.\n\nOverall it is good. Short essential correcting of something very low quality and in reality very dangerious and harmful practice all in the name of something relatively very divine and high quality.  \nMy critical view of his take is very positive.",

    "text": "Yes and yes. Mindfulness and CBT definitely help. Big time.\n\nAbout CBT, try to find a therapist that \"clicks\". Do a lot of reading about CBT books. Listen to podcasts. That will teach you what's a right CBT. Then find a right therapist. Change if you have to.\n\nAbout mindfulness, it's a practice and will not help overnight. But in long term it definitely helps. Anxiety is a paradox where the more you try to fight off unpleasant sensations and thoughts, the more anxious you are. Mindfulness teaches you to accept them and that takes anxiety down by a few notches.\n\nMedications also help. Just rethink long term use. And if you are cutting down, cut down very very very slowly.\n\nAn oyster finds gets discomforted from the grain sand, but by turning it into a pearl it creates something valuable. Just like that if you have anxiety and you build constructive coping mechanisms like Mindfulness and CBT, they can enrich your life a lot more. Be open to the possibility that your anxiety and then your positive coping mechanisms might make you better, calmer, clearer person.\n\nLook for books / podcasts by these people - Susan Orsillo, Joseph Goldstein, John Kabat Zinn, Judith Beck.\n\nIn a little broader context of philosophy / spirituality - Alan Watts, Gangaji, Eckhart Tolle",

I think a.i. induces a lot of existential crisis in people today, or at least it did for me.\n\nSome things to remember:\n\nComputers are complex, especially today and getting more so every year, but humans are even more complex, biological beings are in a completely different category. While it is interesting to draw parallels between machine learning and the human brain, at the end of the day they are nothing alike\n\nYou have free will. It is interesting that Sam Harris focuses so much on the argument that free will is an allusion, while at the same time teaching meditation with his Waking Up app. I would argue that free will is a major pillar of the meditation practice. When your thoughts pass by, YOU remain, your core, your soul, still exists. You experience what it’s like to be you everyday. I would argue that every human on earth also experiences something like what you experience as well. We are not machines at all, we are something more\n\nHumans are ignorant of the true nature of reality, we may not even have to physical capacity to understand what the universe is or how it works. Don’t get ahead of yourself, just appreciate what is and be astonished at the miracle of life, the universe and everything",

    "text": "An easy starting point for consciousness is to ask, What’s it like to be that thing?\n\nSay you could ‘be’ another person for 30 minutes, experience life as them, with their mind, then return to your body and reflect on the experience. It would be *like* something. Broadly similar to your own perceptions. Then go ‘down’ from there. 30 minutes as a chimp. 30 as a mouse. A lizard. Frog. Fish. Each time, it would be *like* something. There would be an experience to reflect on, each time stranger and stranger (as we gets further from the human experience). But consciousness is there, nevertheless, in increasingly rudimentary forms.\n\nWhere does it end? An insect. A jellyfish. A plant. All of these are living things that react in their own way to external stimuli. You’d come away from your 30 minutes like ‘Wow, that was pretty trippy’. \n\nBut spend 30 minutes as a chair. Or a stone. A coffee cup. And it wouldn’t be *like* anything. 30 minutes of complete non-existence, total non-consciousness, a blackout. Personally I think spending 30 minutes as ChatGPT would be like 30 minutes as a microwave, or TV, or radio; it has input and output, but totally lacks subjective experience. Being it for 30 minutes is being nothing for 30 minutes.\n\nI think that’s how we’re different to an LLM. For now at least. But who can say where it’ll go or what it’ll turn into.",

How that happens I don't know, but that's what they found, supposedly. But according to the same people it does work pretty well with coconut milk. No idea if that's the canned stuff or the kind you pour on cereal, but they seem to want a high fat medium. \n\nIf you want to try making it, I recommend you look into it more first and figure out if you have what you need, or if it's worth investing in stuff.  It's a whole ordeal.  Lots of failed attempts for most people, and you never really know what you've cultured in the end, or whether it's good or bad for you. \n\nMight want to just stick with taking the pills as is, instead of doing all that.

I.e. if you're not mentally/emotionally well regulated/healed and together as a person, then it can be hard to get into a clear inner space to do the meditative work. The traditions that use meditation have this integrated into their overall paths as 'right action' and purification practices. I.e. if you lead a good all round healthy/wholesome life, and/or heal from what you did that wasn't in line with that kind of life, then you're in a good place to start meditative work, and go into what's beyond the mind/ego/personality etc.",

    "text": "I find prepping yourself in the evening for the following day is a good thing to do.\n\nIt's so easy after a hard day at work to just get a quick meal, grab a beer and turn the TV on and zone out.\n\nBut I have found that it can be hugely beneficial to drastically reimagine how you spend you evenings.\n\nThis could mean removing TV from your room completely. It will mean that you are far more likely to pick up a book to read or make a nutritious meal or get some exercise or even all three!\n\nAlso, it's sometimes nice to just sit and rest in the evening when there is no pressure to do something and let your thoughts appear to you. That way you can get a sense of the doubts and worries and also good intentions in your mind that otherwise are smothered by binge watching TV or worse the next day when you are facing the world those thoughts might interfere with your activities.\n\nThen over time, maybe a few weeks or months, you might find a growing sense of strength and determination. Or even just a 'flow'.\n\nI really recommend philosophy books, history and science to keep you fascinated in the world. There is so much wonder around us. \n\nPhilosophy helps because it makes you realise that some of the most enquiring and brilliant minds that have ever existed have also struggled with getting a grip on what everything means. And we can gain some of their wisdom and insights and then apply it to our own existences.\n\nBeing alive is a real challenge. But it's also a total miracle!\n\nIf you can, go for walks in nature to reminds yourself of that. \n\nDon't be afraid to make changes. And also, once you've figured out what works for you, don't expect anyone to come and congratulate you for making those changes. It's a lonely way forward! And be careful who you share your truths with. A lot of well meaning people will seek to influence what you do, when you do it and how you do it. It's your life. Only you know what works best for you. With a bit of luck you might meet someone who aligns with your way. \n\n'When in despair be comforted by two facts; that you never know what's round the corner and that life is constant change.'\n\nMarcus Aurelius\n\n\"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone,\"\n\nPascal\n\n'Failure to read whatis happening in anothers soul is not easily seen as a cause of unhappiness but those who fail to attend to the motions of their own soul are necessarily unhappy.'\n\nMarcus Aurelius\n\nGood luck.\n\nPs. I recommend Marcus Aurelius 'Meditations'\nSeneca's 'Letters' and pretty much anything by the contemporary philosopher Buying Chul Han. Also 'Freedom from the Known' by Jiddu Krishnamurti (nothing to to with Hari krishnas)\n\nScience; What is Life by Paul Nurse, Being You by Anith Seth",

    "text": "I learned the hard way that mediation and therapy are not the same thing. They have overlap, and sometimes can be complementary -  but you can’t meditate away your trauma 🥲\n\nI did hours upon hours of meditation - went to Thailand, found a teacher, decided I was a Buddhist. Some days I would meditate up to 8 hours. But I was still depressed. \n\nSo the way I see it. There is the *content* of the thought (let’s say you had a traumatic childhood) and the *structure* of the thought (like a cloud passing through the mind). \n\nThe meditative path is concerned only with structure. “Where do these thoughts come from, where do they go, why does my mind get so stuck on these thoughts?” is the level of analysis we are on. The content is irrelevant, as we are training solely to see reality as it is (illusion of self).\n\nTherapy concerns itself solely with the content. Exploring and analysing how you “feel about your traumatic childhood” and what to do about it. This is very important work not be ignored - this is integration of the self you mentioned. \n\nSo it comes down to the *structure* vs the *content* of your thoughts - and there’s a wonderful interplay between them. The more mindful you become - the more you are able to reflect and grow. And the more mature/ clear you become the more you can settle into the meditative process.",

Something that resets you.\n\nSomething simple, nothing complicated.\n\nSecond, sit in meditation, doing nothing. If you know what I mean, there are thousands of meditation practices that are about doing nothing. Sit in open awareness, just practice allowing. In Zen, this is the practice of Shikantaza. In more modern frameworks, open awareness practice. The goal here is just to let the dust settle. Give the emotional and thinking mind time to settle.\n\nThis alone can help a lot with brain fog. It definitely helps me. The metaphor often used is that of a pool of water: the mind on the surface can be messy, but if you stand still, you sink deeper, where you find more clarity.\n\nFor me though this is not enough, and I need a third step.\n\nThe third step is to set an intention for your next action, and then check in within yourself to make sure most of you is aligned with that intention.\n\nWhile you are still sitting in meditation simply ask yourself what you would like to do next. Pick the first answer that comes up, but then keep inquiring within other parts of you: does this seem right to all of me? You may find conflicting opinions. Different parts of you have different ideas. That's great. This is where clarity of mind is reached, by allowing an inner debate. Try to listen to all of you. Sense somatically if an agreement has been reached. You may need to compromise between different parts.\n\nAnd then, stand up and start following up on your intention. Action driven by a clear intention helps a lot.\n\nHope this helps, as much as it helps me. 🙏",

    "text": "Interesting, though I would say that awareness is not something that can be done, as it is the field of awareness and everything that one experiences occurs within this field. It is the field of experience of the five senses and mind. You can pay attention to specific parts of this field, but there will always be awareness of other experiences/things that occur in the periphery or the background, perhaps unless you are really focused and in a state of meditative absorption.\n\nSo awareness cannot be practiced, but what one pays attention to and how you pay attention to it, as well as how you reflect on that, this is the part that can be seen as a practice.\n\nYou can pay attention to experience in a way that is very similar to awareness, meaning you can stay at contact, or keep returning to it, contact meaning the raw experience of something that is occurring now in any of the five senses or mind. But awareness, does itself continually, so it cannot be practiced. It is the groundless ground of all one's experience and even the self concept is something that appears within this.\n\nAwareness is quite likely produced by the brain and the rest of the nervous system, functioning together. But from the experiential viewpoint, awareness is simply what is now in the senses and mind. If there is no awareness, there is no experience, not even the experience of a gap of experience. So the most consistent thing that is present in all experience is awareness. One might relax into it, or one might pay attention in a way that is closely in harmony with it, and then get a clear sense of it, but awareness itself cannot be practiced or done.\n\nSo awareness is like the field of experience and attention moves along, or through this field, like a torch or a lens, and can highlight experiences/things and bring them into focus, making them more foreground, more relatively center, for as long as one is focusing on something particular within this field of awareness. This attention can be on various stages of the process of conception, and mindfulness is often about keeping it on the level of raw experience, which is known as contact. The attention can be narrow or it can be wide, it can be more consistent or it can move from one thing to another. Having consistent attention to the experience of something occurring now is what is traditionally considered meditation such as mindfulness of breathing, though of course it is also possible to allow the attention to move from one thing/experience to another in a more flowing way.",

    "text": "Oh man this is such a good post. I can absolutely relate to crushing feelings of shame after screwing up. I'm sorry you're feeling this.\n\n\nFirst, I would recognize that what you're feeling is a sign that you care. A lot. That's further than a lot of people get after they make a mistake, so allow yourself that recognition.\n\n\nI try to bring it back to what I can control. I can't undo what happened. But I can sit with the shame, recognize what I'm feeling, and then see what I can actually fix, even if it's just learning from it or creating a plan to make sure I'm less likely to make the same mistake again. Because at the end of the day, that's all you can really do. And when those feelings creep in again, I try to bring it back to that commitment I made to do better.\n\n\nI also try to remind myself of the human condition. I sure love to try to be perfect, but as much as I try, I simply can't be. It isn't possible. So again, returning myself to what I can control. Acknowledging/sitting with the feelings, learning from it, and attempting to re-ground in the present.\n\n\nOne resource I really like is Tara Brach. Not sure if you've heard of her, but she's a psychologist turned spiritual teacher. She has at least one talk on this subject https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E588epxf2R8&pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD\n\n\nWishing you healing as you work through this very relatable struggle.",

I used mindfulness techniques to improve things; specifically I decided I was done punishing myself (second arrows often serve no purpose) and when the painful thoughts would arise I would let the thought pass through and leave rather than allow it to consume me by dwelling in the thought (thought is too small a word because it’s more like a complete soup-to-nuts lucid dream in which I am a loser who screwed up). By letting the thought pass I would find (if I even remembered) that soon that seeming reality where I am a loser was gone and instead I was noticing my senses and all the good that is present now. \n\nEventually the second arrows stopped trying and I moved on and now I rarely think about it. Time + resolving not to allow that negative thought to dwell in me when it arose was what worked.",

And just say \"Hey, kids don't do what I did.\" Everyone may make a mistake but it's so important to just apologize if you do. \n\nUse it as a learning experience to touch on how we may do or say things that we don't intend to do, by accident or just without thinking. Ask them have they ever done something that they regret, etc. \n\nStress the importance of a sincere apology and what that means. \"I'm sorry that I did that - that must have been very upsetting to you.

Write on the list everything being angry gains you and then everything it costs you. Then ask yourself the question: can I afford to stay angry?\nSay the answer out loud. This is only one idea. Ultimately it’s up to you to practice acceptance that there are things that you can control in life and things you cannot. You cannot control other people‘s opinions, or their opinions of you. You cannot control when you will get angry. But you can control what you do when the anger arrives.",

You're likely not going to change anyone's mind and if you argue with them, especially when you're angry, they'll tend to dig their heels in.\n\nTo actually let go of anger it needs to be felt through. It's not that the anger itself is an issue but that we tend to have a detrimental, resistant relationship to emotions we don't want to feel. If you were perfectly okay with feeling anger it wouldn't be a problem and it wouldn't compel you to argue back. It's the resistance to the anger that causes the \"I *can't* just sit by...\"\n\nYou might even see this as a great opportunity to develop a more effective relationship with anger. When it arises, you might ask yourself \"is it okay to just feel this anger?\" Notice where it shows up in the body. Are you okay with being aware of those sensations? Can you surrender the need to *do* anything about the anger?\n\nAnd if internal peace and calm weren't good enough motivations, once you start shifting your relationship to anger it can become pleasant fuel for skillful interactions. When you can remain present and mindful, and the compulsions drop away, you will become much more effective at creating the change you'd like to see.",

I would suggest you to consider learning the teachings of the Buddha with an inquisitiveness, and practice in line with them while independently observing the arising qualities in the mind. When this is done with dedication for a period of time, say several months, a year or two, the mind will be able to cultivate wisdom about what hurt it in the past so that it is not hurt anymore, to have initiative, to come closer to one’s true purpose, to having blossoming personal and professional relationships.",

So as a doorway there's a pointlessness/futility that becomes more apparent. \n\nAs we surrender our wanting, chasing, and trying towards nothingness we find release. When we've released enough...We naturally realize Rest.\n\nIn Rest we forget to feel any specific way. Our emotions reset, and so does our mind.\n\nFrom rest comes more energy. To want again, chase again, and try again. Yet this time wiser, more discerning, and Self-secure, dependent only on how smoothly and transparently you received the prior moment.\n\nThis is the nature of refreshing and growth.\n\nThe better you learn, the less of a drag it all feels. The gravity of the \"bad\" fades and what's left is a simple clarity. You get to learn without taking it so personally, to understand that the nature of life has always been change , and embody that your body's balance and stress response don't have to be held hostage by what you interpret to be happening at any given moment.\n\nA lot of growing up is \"it wasn't as big of a deal as I made it out to be\" in hindsight. This keeps you fresh. But parts of us get stuck in the past. They need support, some nudging, some patience... and then they get back up to speed and roll into the whole of who we are Now.\n\nBut we've got to be willing to slow down and care for those stuck parts, otherwise the more we leave them behind the worse we feel.\n\nYour emotions are just feedback to help you address what your body's energy/motivation habit need to reset, update, and upgrade. They never last beyond the need they're representing. The more those core needs are fulfilled the lighter they are until we get back to our natural balance of total ease. \n\nThe heaviest, densest, and/or numbest of feelings tend to be representing a need for the radical surrender of who we think we are, and how we tend to feel around the situation in question. To accept that our want was imaginary, what occured was what it was meant to be, and our feeling and opinion about it is more rooted in habit than validity. \n\nAs such we take responsibility for how we feel, forgive the world, and are continuously reborn as newer, more resilient, and consistent harmonious/flowing individuals.\n\nSo take time to let yourself feel this as deeply as you can. Lick your wounds. And before you know it you'll be surprised by how old it all gets and how easily you remember how to be as fresh as you were.\n\nIt's okay. You're okay. And it's okay that it takes time. 🙏🏽",

    "text": "Neat thanks. I like learning about the histories and other foundational works of people who have ideas that really fit into a place in me. I know ai is like the worst or whatever but here’s the answer I got from deep seek about James’ work. Since it was his idea Carnegie was referring to when you came across it. Just in case anyone else is the same kind of nerd I am: \n\nGreat! Here’s a curated guide to diving into William James’s works, tailored to different interests:\n\n---\n\n### **Where to Start with William James**  \n#### 1. **For Practical Wisdom & Everyday Psychology**  \n   - ***Talks to Teachers on Psychology*** (1899)  \n     - **Why**: Short, engaging essays on habit, attention, and education. Perfect if you want actionable advice (the \"day-tight compartments\" idea appears here!).  \n     - **Themes**: How to cultivate focus, build good habits, and live intentionally.  \n\n#### 2. **For Philosophy & Life’s Big Questions**  \n   - ***The Will to Believe and Other Essays*** (1897)  \n     - **Why**: A collection of accessible, thought-provoking essays on faith, morality, and decision-making.  \n     - **Key Essay**: *The Gospel of Relaxation* (where he discusses mental compartmentalization).  \n\n#### 3. **For Psychology Enthusiasts**  \n   - ***The Principles of Psychology*** (1890)  \n     - **Why**: The cornerstone of modern psychology. Start with chapters on **habit** and **stream of consciousness** (they’re iconic and readable).  \n     - **Caution**: It’s dense—skip around rather than reading cover-to-cover!  \n\n#### 4. **For Spirituality & Human Experience**  \n   - ***The Varieties of Religious Experience*** (1902)  \n     - **Why**: Explores mysticism, conversion, and how belief shapes lives. Non-dogmatic and deeply human.  \n     - **Highlight**: Case studies of personal transformation and resilience.  \n\n---\n\n### **If You Prefer Shorter Reads**  \n- Look for essay anthologies like *William James: Writings 1902–1910* (Library of America). These include excerpts from his major works and lectures.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Themes Linked to \"Day-Tight Compartments\"**  \nJames’s advice to focus on the present overlaps with:  \n- **Habit formation** (*Principles of Psychology*): How routines free mental energy.  \n- **The Will to Believe**: Choosing optimism and action despite uncertainty.  \n- **Pragmatism**: Judging ideas by their practical impact on daily life.  \n\n---\n\n### **Pro Tip**  \nJames’s writing is conversational and full of vivid metaphors (like comparing the mind to a \"snowball\" growing as it rolls). Don’t rush—savor his clarity and wit!",

    "text": "You make good observations about flow and mindfulness. I suspect that as your experience with your art increases, you will learn to almost be of two minds in those moments - the trained, reflexive, flow mind, and a separate awareness of the moment when you call upon it. At least that's how I experience it.\n\nDoom scrolling isn't flow, although superficially they may appear similar because in both cases you are, as you note, absorbed.\n\nFlow happens when you're fully engaged - using your mind and perhaps your body so intently and with such focus that time suspends. Flow is when you are your best self. Doomscrolling mimics the \"reward system\" of flow by making you feel absorbed, but it's empty and you're neither deep in thought nor accomplishing anything.\n\nA good analogy might be how a drug like heroin makes someone \"feel good\" by hijacking the brain's reward system. But the feels were mimicked chemically rather than earned, and you aren't accomplishing anything, so they pass when the drug wears off, and leave you worse, rather than better, off. In contrast, feeling good by pursuing something you truly enjoy leaves you enriched and better off after the good feelings pass - you earn skill or friendship or health from your activity and the activity that generated the good feelings moves you forward. \\[Sidebar: there's a neat but simple discussion of how and why this is so in Jonathan Haidt's book, The Happiness Hypothesis\\].\n\nAs for the definition of mindfulness. I like the aphorism, \"where you stand depends on where you sit.\" I think it's going to be different for each person, depending where they are in their personal journey and what they're seeking. For me, a simple definition is best: awareness.",

Lost a mother and sister to suicidal, never met my father, etc… I have been married for 16 years and we have had our struggles, but largely due to my emptiness I carried for years. What worked for me was finding a spiritual side of life that resonated with me, which was similar to “spiritual awakening” type process. I found ALL the peace and answers to why I felt what I felt. I had to do a lot of research, which led to deep self reflection/listening to my every thought. This led me into meditation of all kinds, and it truly saved my life. I have learned to see my thoughts, but not get emotionally attached to them. This process led me to being able to live again, trust again, trust my process through this life, and the biggest part was realizing the actually power of the higher power, which is all around us. \n\nThis is hard to explain, and I’ve never been good writing long detailed messages. Maybe just start looking into spiritual awakening, and let that research guide you, maybe you can find love and happiness again. It just takes controlling your thoughts. My biggest lesson has been that my thoughts controlled my life and I was never educated on how much our thoughts spiraled, it’s wild when you really observe them. When you do this, you be aware at all times. Our thoughts are not us, we have to take control of them to control our life. All kinds of good research, meditation styles, and articles to read, so try as many as possible and go with what resonates, and keep going deeper!

But the real happiness comes within ourselves. First learn to love yourself before search it from someone or something. We human only have 70-100 years of lifespan, so don’t waste it enjoy every moment of it   Once a moment pass you never can get back to it. Life is too precious to waste it on sadness or any negativity.",

So, the focus on the present (awareness without judgment) also excludes distractions. You don't have to expend effort to exclude distractions because being in the present excludes distractions by definition, in the same way that focusing on the road while driving excludes focusing on your phone.",

    "text": "I find myself working with a similar theme recently but have framed it as dropping judgment (which arguably is synonymous with belief.) As you note, I've also realized that many of the stories I subconsciously tell myself are judgments, which I don't know to be true, masquerading as fact.\n\nLearning to clearly differentiate judgment from fact has been an eye opening endeavor. Judgment is the way we make meaning out of neutral, objective information. We're constantly making judgments thinking they're facts, not realizing the implications. I think this is particularly detrimental, and limiting, because the judgments are more general than the facts, they cover a larger area and carry more weight.\n\nFor example say I failed a test and developed the judgment (or belief) \"I'm no good at math\" which has broad and far reaching implications. But the judgment really isn't true, or is only true for a very limited case which the thought \"I'm no good at math\" hides. What we might say is something like \"I got a 4/10 on this math test the first time I took it.\"\n\nLike yourself I've also found these beliefs tend to live at the edge of my comfort zone. So I've been working with them first by identifying what is a judgment versus what is a clear fact and then also by pushing the edge of my comfort zone. In particular I notice there's a tendency to cling to judgments out of aversion towards uncertainty. The more comfortable I am with uncertainty the less I need to hold on to judgments.\n\nI also agree that we don't want to just delude ourselves with layers of \"positive thinking.\" I think the positive thinking, when it's inauthentic, also results in limiting ourselves. Rather than trying to replace the old beliefs I just allow myself to sit in not knowing, uncertainty, a sort of \"wait and see\" and run experiments.",

Noticing peace began with this: stopping the self-judgment and starting to listen to myself with honesty.

So for example, if the thought comes up, and you feel it in the pit of your stomach, you would note \"Feel\", Unplesant.  Don't suppress the feeling just Note it.

It also connects You, the User as an interface with the Body, connecting you to this external world.\n\nThe Body speaks in sensation and visceral emotion. The Mind translates this into thoughts and feelings that we, the User/Spirit can decipher. But sense the Mind is the interface between, it has its own processes to make the connection smoother. Our Minds created language to better compartmentalise sensation and visceral emotion into thoughts and feelings we can name and understand more effectively.\n\nBut the Mind is a feedback loop to the external world, which includes the Body. So what we allow it to believe, becomes present in our external reality and as sensation in our bodies. If we let the mind believe we are sad, we will continue to few sad and experience things that make us sad.\n\nBelief is the root of all things. What you believe is put through the feedback loop into the external world. The external world is a mirror to your state of mind and beliefs. What we believe, we will be, and will become of the world around us. If we believe we have an anger problem, we will have an anger problem, and will begin to see more things in the world that make us angry.\n\nBut if we believe, “there are injustices in this world that bother me; but it is a waste of time trying to fight every battle”, the loop will feed this to the Body and external world. You will begin to see the battles and choose not to fight. You will see that people are caught up in their own battles in their lives. It’s nothing personal. Everyone is struggling to stabilise their feedback loop of beliefs. \n\nNow, rather than being led astray by your Mind-Body, you are now in control of your actions. You, the User, control the feedback loop. By coming to all situations with understanding that everyone is trying to stabilise their feedback loop. It is a difficult process, because our world is, by its nature, one of chaos, big and small.\n\nEnlightenment is this understanding. It is simple. “Everyone is fighting a battle you can’t see.” It’s not just a corny quote. It’s the Way.\n\nSome call it Samsara. Some reincarnation. Some the Mortal Toil. But the journey to enlightenment is to understand this, and try to help others understand it. But help them lightly and gently. Their journey is still their own. \n\nThis is the Way.",

    "text": "Something I've incorporated into my routine and that has made a significant difference is the daily recording of automatic thoughts, especially those that arise during moments of emotional discomfort. The first step is to the thought as it appears, without filters. Then, I analyze its content more closely: I ask myself whether I'm generalizing, catastrophizing, or assuming something is true based on fear or insecurity. This practice helps me distinguish between a momentarily emotional reaction and what actually makes sense in light of reality.\n\nJust the act of writing already brings mental clarity, but the real impact lies in gaining distance from dysfunctional thought patterns. It's a form of training in self-awareness and emotional regulation. Over time,I began to notice that certain repetitive ideas stopped carrying the same weight. And it was through this process of looking at what I think and feel with more clarity, that I started to find something more stable than immediate happiness: a state of inner peace that doesn't rely so much on circumstances, but rather on how I relate to what happens to me.",

Nonetheless, here is the answer I received.\n\nI am not living in a way that is aligned with my highest self. Not just in the actions I take, but in terms of what I choose to believe. This makes sense to me. Have I corrected this? Not in every way but in small ways, sometimes trying, sometimes failing.\n\nBut the shift for me is to understand that the light is there, and it is true, but the work to align myself to it, is my own responsibility. Sometimes this doesn’t seem fair, and sometimes the energy required to turn towards the light is too much, and very easily darkness takes over. It’s not fair, but at least the mechanism makes a bit more sense to me now.\n\nOne thing that definitely helps is to see light and dark as complementary and essential, not as victory and loss.",

You can have all this goodness back! You just need to light up one cigarette!\".\n\nI was prepared. I had an index card that I carried around with the top five reasons I was quitting written on them. During those craving moments, I would pull out the card and reaffirm my intention to 'never smoke another cigarette in my life\". \n\nIt worked. 51 years later and I have never smoked another cigarette since then. \n\nThe cravings will eventually start to be less frequent, but it took a looooooooonnnnnggg time. Remember, many people consider quitting smoking harder than quitting heroin.\n\nHell, every once in a while I 'still' crave a smoke!

I too smoked for about 11 years and recently quit and the sensation you think is craving is actually habitual and you’re so so close!! Just keep it at it and remember to give yourself grace and don’t forget to be proud. Meditation helped me so much and just not ignoring the feeling of craving, but actually feeling it, witnessing it, sometimes even calling it by name: hello old friend - it lessened its intensity and before you know it your mind is into something else. Good luck to you! Oh and also, make sure your hands are busy, even if it’s typing or something small or cooking or a stress ball - that helps too",

I wasn't even that hardcore about it, but every time I tried to walk away I was like, I've had a bad day and made excuse after excuse. One day I had a chest xray done because I had lost weight working out and trying to make healthier choices. I have an abnormal rib in my chest that is rounded out more for some reason. Must be from birth and I never noticed it because I was a chubby kid until I started working out at 20. When they told me I didn't have anything odd in the xray and made a second appointment to be sure there was no lung cancer or anything....I cried for two hours after even though they told me everything was fine. At that point I really was like...what am I doing to myself if I am going to be so scared and worried about lung cancer? Grandpa died from it and started smoking before he was diagnosed, so didn't have that in my mind when I first started. Anyways! Long story short, not smoked in 10 years and the first two to three are really hard. Every time I was driving and smelled it from a car in front of me, not gonna lie, it triggered cravings. Craved it when I drank for sure, but I was good and didn't cave. Now I don't care about it at all and will never go back. Keep going. It's so hard, but the reward is worth it when you look back and are like,\" wow, I really risked my health and wasted 5 to 10 minutes each time I smoked a cig.\" It's just not worth it.",

    "text": "Mindfulness means awareness and we are that, already inherent in us and our true nature and our natural state of Be-ing. It is called awareness due to distraction of multivarious thoughts. It is awareness that dispels distractive, destructive, intrusive, anxious, invasive thoughts which every mindful being or simply a witness of those thoughts is trying to achieve without identifying with them, judging, condemning those thoughts but simply being aware of them as a passing show.\n\nUnnecessary thoughts (over thinking) are the obstacle to your perception. It starts with simple awareness which will lead you to heightened awareness-consciousness already inherent in us and our natural state\n\nThis repeated awareness, and constantly bringing the mind back to its rightful place of awareness strengthens the mind which got weak due to its wanderings and cannot resist the temptations of distractive thoughts, but with persistence it can regain its composure and stick to one thought.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you've noticed yourself.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

I don't think the craving ever went away completely, but it got gradually easier over the first 6 months to the point of not really bothering me. Not resisting the feeling makes it a lot easier when it hits, just let yourself feel the craving and notice that it's okay to feel it. That alone does wonders once you get that down, trust me. Wellbutrin (Bupropion) also helps and is generally very easy to get off of after.\n\nAlso, if quitting feels really difficult due to brain fog, focus problems etc. even after the first months, might wanna get yourself checked for ADHD. Nicotine and caffeine are often used to self-medicate and people with ADHD reportedly have a much harder time quitting them because it's not just the withdrawal, but also ADHD symptoms worsening. Never in a million years would I have guessed I had it, because I'm not usually hyperactive on the outside, but now I'm waiting for a diagnosis appointment and it seems pretty clear cut after looking into it properly and the general doctor administering some tests.",

    "text": "Be aware of your thoughts not theirs. They're just thoughts. Now that the mind got agitated the ego will replay this scene over and over again causing you pain as if someone puts a sharp pin in you.\n\nYou can't change the world and you know it but you can transform yourself. Those people you've mentioned are running on autopilot in psychic sleep and any thought can take them over but it shouldn't be your case if you're mindful of  your mind. It's not easy of letting go we're all faced with those obstacles. Here's some tips you may find helpful in the future.\n\n\n\nMindfulness means awareness and we are that, already inherent in us and our true nature and our natural state of Be-ing. It is called meditation due to distraction of multivarious thoughts. It is awareness that dispels distractive, destructive, intrusive, anxious, invasive thoughts which every mindful being or simply a witness of those thoughts is trying to achieve without identifying with them, judging, condemning those thoughts but simply being aware of them as a passing show.\n\nUnnecessary thoughts (over thinking) are the obstacle to your perception. It starts with simple awareness which will lead you to heightened awareness-consciousness already inherent in us and our natural state\n\nThis repeated awareness, and constantly bringing the mind back to its rightful place of awareness strengthens the mind which got weak due to its wanderings and cannot resist the temptations of distractive thoughts, but with persistence it can regain its composure and stick to one thought.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you've noticed yourself.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

    "text": "At the end of the day, nothing you feel about yourself arises outside of your own mind. Only if your mind accepts what others think about you can it impact you, which is why loving someone with trauma doesn't necessarily make them feel better and can make them feel quite a lot of pain. \n\nWhile it's absolutely true that external factors can influence you and lead to improvements in well-being, and while I'd definitely not advise people to be ignorant to reality, whether or not something such as others opinions of you impacts you is a matter of whether your mind finds that significant or not.\n\nRelationships are good, especially when loving. However you can absolutely build a foundation of happiness from internal factors such as mindfulness, compassion and love, as well as wisdom. This should not be the end point, but it does mean you do not depend on the uncontrollable and constantly shifting external world (relationships included) and can act wisely and compassionately to others more easily.",

It covers much of this, and it doesn't subscribe to the supernatural elements either. Others criticise it, but whatever. A good start I'm sure.\n\nEdit: for a potentially more satisfying answer. Loving-kindness meditation can help build love within yourself. Equanimity is the ability to be with whatever arises in a balanced state, which is very useful during suffering.

However, because I was in a needy place when I was younger, my choice reflected my state of being and as you can imagine, was pretty much a dumpster fire and didn’t last long. Fast forward a few decades and a lot of spiritual work, and my current marriage is indicative of my spiritual, mental, and physical health.

    "text": "So happy I came across your post as I have recently been struggling with the same thing myself! When I have felt tears start to well up, I’ll try and be extra gentle, telling myself something along the lines of ‘everything is ok / it’s ok to let it out / this is safe place to let go’ and yet that has only seemed to have the opposite effect! The urge to cry will immediately go away. It has been frustrating and also slightly scary as I used to always be someone who cried easily. And I never felt embarrassed or ashamed by crying either. In fact I love crying and find it very healthy and natural! \n\nI don’t really have a solution either but I do agree with the other person who commented saying to watch a video and feel what the other person is feeling. I have noticed that I am able to cry freely (even if it’s not a full release) when I am focused on other people and their emotions whether this is from watching a video or movie, reading a book, or even just thinking about someone going through an emotional experience.\n\nI think the other important piece is to not internalize a negative message about ourselves for not being able to cry (you mentioned feeling like you ‘completely shut yourself off’). I feel like the more I think about how I’m feeling off/not myself for not being able to cry, the more my anxiety about this grows. I don’t want to force anything either but I also don’t think my body can feel truly safe to release these emotions when my mind/thoughts are sending the messages that something is “off”. \n\nLastly, I think it’s important to focus on “small” releases. Release doesn’t always have to be bawling your eyes out. It can happen in other, subtler ways too. Maybe it’s taking a bath, or going for a late night drive to clear your head, or dancing around your house while belting the lyrics to a song you love. Identify the activities that resonate with you, recognize when you engage in them, and most importantly, feel proud of yourself for showing up for you and doing the work.",

Oxytocin in particular can really zap a woman's body.  Rhythmic mindful hand movements can re-source oxytocin, which can restore emotional access.\n\nWest African dance is on the list because it has motions that mimmic harvesting plants.  Additionally it is performed barefoot, and has rhythmic drumming - both of which will help you get back fully into the body.  (in case the dullness includes a bit of disconnection)\n\nIf there is potentially a depression element interplaying with the numbness, handwrite 3 pages of stream of consciousness journaling - no stopping, no editing, just flow out the random nonsense floating around in there, even if it's merely 3 pages of \"this is so dumb, why did I listen to that coo coo puff on the inteernet?,,?\".  \n\nEssentially, treat the emotional block as though it were a creative block and see what happens when you pour the gunk out onto the page so the real stuff can come out to play.\n\n(as someone who spend a couple decades suppressing and repressing emotions, there *is* a way back; and a healthy relationship with emotions *is* completely achievable)",

    "text": "There's an inherent problem in listening to advice from people who are not or who have not been in your exact same position. Their well-meaning advice simply doesn't work for you and leaves you worse off, and you have to deal with the consequences of it anyway as they can't relate and dismiss you, lol.\n\nI experienced this form of exercise intolerance when I was suffering from crippling insomnia. I would go hiking for hours, run, try lifting weights with progressive overloads, and would go rock climbing with friends who said that it would tire me out and help me sleep. My joints and muscles would be sore for days, and it would make my choppy 3 hours of sleep even worsenwith all the tossing and turning. They said that it helped them sleep and should help me sleep.\n\nFar from it. On a good day, I already experience physical sensations much more strongly and acutely than most of my friends and family members. For most of the year, breathing is a struggle from pollen, mold, and other allergens, especially exhaust from cars and freshly caught grass. I also have misophonia and get irritated from excess clothing on my skin. I hate and refuse to wear jeans; they can all burn for all I care. Bars and loud places are sensory hell for me, and I rarely listen to music in the car (usually if a passenger is feeling restless from the silence). Traffic is a nightmare that I dread, so it was no surprise that 2020 was the best year of my life.\n\nNow, that being said, what I found that helped me were body scans and yoga nidra guided meditations. When I was experiencing insomnia, anxiety, and major depression, these practices helped me to gently cultivate interoception. I was able to more deeply explore the tension that was accumulating in my body, and as I simply held my attention at one spot and then the next, the tissues began to relax on their own as I was withdrawing my awareness from the world of the senses as well as from worries of past and future. I could be fully present with the experiences within my body, and I started to relax more and more deeply. In yoga nidra, similar effects would happen with the breath awareness techniques and gentler pranayama. The tension would dissolve at the subtler layers. Next, with recreation and/or sensing of opposites like heaviness & lightness or heat & cold or pain & pleasure, I was able to explore one sensation in my body while in a relaxed state and then its polar opposite. I would alternate between the two in my own time and my own rhythm before holding both in my awareness, without merging them (and in later practices, allowing them to merge in whatever way that took place). This helped me to develop greater equanimity, and I would be able to develop greater stress tolerance to my environment as I continued to relax more and more no matter what I was experiencing, which even helps with inflammation from allergy symptoms. With rapid image visualizations in yoga nidra, I would continue to refine the witness perspective and allow mental and emotional debris to surface and be processed more on its own. The intention-setting practice also helped a ton.\n\nEventually, these meditations helped me restore my sleep, thank God, and I could more readily fall back asleep with ease. \n\nIn short, when presented with exercise intolerance, use systematic relaxation techniques to allow the tension and soreness to heal from the densest to the subtlest layers of your being. Once you do this consistently, you will be physically restored, sleep more soundly and deeply, and will be able to witness discomfort with a greater tolerance (because your energy levels and tissues are renewed, you don't have so much chronic tension but up already, and you will have cultivated equanimity as well).",

    "text": "I tried mushrooms for the first time about 3 months after my mother died.    That was the most cathartic cry I've ever had.     I didn't cry when she passed, and it caught up to me in that moment, after I'd been feeling a connection to everyone outside of time, and I cried for the passing of all the creatures who aren't with me anymore, or who won't be with me in the future.      It's been a couple years since that experiment (guided by a professional)  and have not cried like that since, although a couple times \"wish you were here\" came on the car radio while I was driving, and I almost cried, but the light changed and I had to drive.  Time and the real world are so demanding.\n\nI've been diagnosed with dysthymia.  \"bad mind\"    Essentially a mild constant depression, like I do not feel things like other people do.   I don't know if this dysthymia is how I was born, how I was raised, or a response to the various traumas I've had.     That was what I was trying to medicate with the mushrooms.          I sit on the fence about this.    The dysthymia is handy in a crisis.     e.g. if someone dies, I keep my head, and manage the crisis.   At work, when everything hits the fan, I'm the one that keeps calm and fixes it.      I keep expecting more traumas, reasonably for my situation, and the dysthymia is a protection from that anticipation and the traumas themselves. \n\nDown side of this, is I don't feel happy.   I don't get the positive.   I went to see a somaticist a few years ago who was encouraging me to feel feelings in my body, as a way to try to combat the dysthymia or to feel better.    It has been difficult for me to notice different feelings in my body, I am not entirely convinced I have them.   It is all the same \"freeze\" state.  \n\nWhen all else fails, lower your expectations.   This could just be how I am, I don't remember different.   That's how it is dysthymia and not depression for me, depression the word indicates less than normal, this is my normal.     But I can see the advantage to it, I can accept this is how I am.    The only problem with it is really only that I'm a bummer to be around, and my relationships suffer for it.   But, my closest relationship is also the source of my trauma, past and anticipated.   \n\nI've mostly given up on the idea of salvation.   There's been enough attempts, on my part and by others for that, that while I can't rule it out, my hope for any sort of salvation diminishes.  My current mindset is to accept that this is it.    I am never going to better than I am now, than I was before.   Can I live with this?  Sure.  What's the problem really?   I'm not crying, there is no problem.   At some point, maybe I can stop trying to be better, and just be.\n\nIf you used to feel things, good for you.  I can't physically focus well enough to read fine print anymore, but I know it just says \"you're on you're own we're going to screw you\" because I've read enough of it.       Might be what happens with feelings too.   I think all the things that happen, that you feel when you are younger, just kind of pile on, and you stop feeling more.  This is fine.",

    "text": "Definitely rather \"Buddhist\" (although I know hardly anything about it) but the anxiety of that would probably quickly disappear since I already know how to meditate well. I posted the same thing on r/Meditation and got worse but more responses. Looking at the Amazon reviews, it appears to be one of those books that may be based more on a private (even if academic) interpretation of what \"Buddhist\" meditation is. It also seems to be somewhat metaphorical. But I'll probably try it.\n\nBuddhism seems to be one of the least dogmatic (and thereby owing to many interpretations, much of which may be due to the disconnection of the Himalayan region.) religions there is (whereas the Catholic Church would be the most, as it has twenty or so ecumenical councils that have long and clear explanations for its dogmas. I'm not necessarily trying to convert anyone, but rather emphasize a point about the epistemology of truth. I don't know if there's any Buddhist establishment that claims to have dogmas.)\n\nAnother thing is that I do intend on reaching that state more or less akin to \"nirvana\". The fact that I've given up almost all Internet (and don't intend to come back) for about a year now illustrates my dedication. I'm afraid the mind-wandering of the Internet may render many meditators incapable of reaching their goal. But I can't be absolutely certain. I've read some of the (I use this term very informally) science about that. Right now in fact I'm feeling that \"nirvana\" or emptiness, but not perfectly. My main personal problem is that I do too much original thinking and my OCD makes my executive function poor and that I can be afraid to dive into foreign areas (this is getting much better, though, and it's not seeking personal advice but illustrating a common mistake.)\n\nIf you're interested, I do have a literal, phenomenological interpretation of the \"look for the looker\" phrase of Sam Harris, which, when it is clear, gives me an extraordinary and quick ability to focus. I can't explain it fully in this comment, but the gist is that consciousness is a screen, and that when you focus on the screen (which is the \"looker,\" or that which \\*is\\* looking) producing consciousness at any given angle, then your focus can be maintained on that point via the means of empty, effortless clarity. Having some degree of visual snow can make this more apparent. Another way to explain it is that the perception of your face is the looker, and it's looking towards the screen of consciousness, and then you might sort of focus on the space between these two views. It's also important to relax your muscles naturally when you get tense.\n\nI have also literally felt what \"enlightenment\" is. There have been times when I have been consistently meditative that consciousness itself truly is illuminated by a distinct brightness that is similar to putting glasses on. However, it can make my visual snow (light patterns, TV-ish static, floaters, etc.) much more apparent.\n\nIt's not unlikely that a scientist may give an almost foolproof method of focusing meditatively, but it is unlikely that it would revolutionize the world.  It also might be the explanation for the weird black slate in 2001 a space odyssey.",

    "text": "All right, I'm going to be the voice of dissent here. Sort of. :D\n\nYou said that you're not trying to force yourself to cry, and I would very much agree with that approach, which is why I wouldn't recommend various of the ideas from other comments that involve creating a situation in which you're more likely to cry. Manufactured feelings are very different from real feelings. You already know this because you've tried to make yourself enjoy things when it doesn't come naturally. Trying to consciously create feelings never really works.\n\nThe more important aspect, I think, is that it's easy to read too much into your current way of being. It's easy to feel like, on some level, feeling emotionally blocked is \"bad\". With that as your foundation, any attempts to change will always carry a sense of struggle and disconnect because of how the current situation feels like something you need to change, and a tendency to overcorrect.\n\nFor instance, your wondering if \"feeling that deeply\" will help: sort of, but \"deeply\" is probably very much the wrong word. If you \"zoom in\" on a feeling and get all focused on it, that tends to strengthen it. People build up their bad feelings all the time, simply by wallowing in them. It doesn't take much to turn a molehill into a mountain!\n\nSo, if you go into this with the idea that the more deeply you try to feel the crying, the better, that's not exactly right. The real aim is to feel the feeling exactly as it is – no more, no less. That involves staying mindful throughout so you don't get carried away by the current.\n\nSimilarly, it's not true that crying more is better. It's a fairly short distance from \"if I cry that will release things\" to a less conscious \"I need to cry more\", and then you'll find yourself crying more often without, necessarily, any actual benefit to it. Who knows, perhaps half the time releasing something doesn't need any crying at all! (And people who, for example, listen to sad songs when they feel sad aren't actually helping themselves in any way, it's just easier to indulge the feelings than to let them run their course.)\n\nRelease happens by letting things happen and not interfering. If you don't judge, fight, argue with, ignore, ... then a sensation/feeling can run its course, and something else will follow. Maybe that will be another sensation/feeling (maybe even a more intense one), maybe a sudden realization, maybe just nothing in particular. The point is, let things run their course and then do the same thing to whatever comes after, and that's literally all you ever need to do. Your mind will do the rest.\n\nHow do you start feeling more things? Just remove any obstacles to feelings. Don't think of feelings as bad. Don't think of the lack of feelings as bad. Don't encourage or discourage feelings. Paradoxically, not encouraging the feelings to happen actually makes it easier for them to start coming up in their own time.\n\nWhen a feeling does come up, old habits will tend to dictate how you react to them, and your habits will tend to be the same ones that led to you feeling emotionally blocked in the first place. This is why the process is best started within mindfulness exercises: as you do an exercise, just understand that feelings might start coming up in subtle ways, and the best way to respond to them is to just observe without encouraging or discouraging them. Look for any changes without expecting anything in particular. Any time you do this, you make a tiny bit of progress, even if it won't seem like it.\n\nThe final thing I want to say: trust your mind to pick a good pace. If there was a magic wand I could wave to totally unblock your feelings instantly, would that really be a good thing? Or would you be overwhelmed because you're completely out of practice dealing with intense emotions? The latter, most likely, right? If you don't try to help things along, e.g. by not looking for any *specific* feelings during an exercise, your mind will naturally tend to start with tiny things, and then slightly less tiny things, and before you know it, you're in a totally different place, without ever really noticing any big shift. It might take a month or three, but so what? That still beats getting nowhere in two weeks, and it also beats getting nowhere in two or six cycles of two weeks each.",

    "text": "I've spent quite a few minutes trying to think of a more gentle way of saying this, but let's just throw it out there: I actually think you might have it a little backwards. However I'm not writing this to convince you of anything, and I'm totally willing to admit that I might be wrong. I just want to suggest that you consider thinking about this a little differently for a minute or two, and see where that takes you. If, at the end, you decide that what I wrote doesn't make sense, I'm totally fine with that.\n\nBased on what you've written, it seems like you've come to think of crying as a positive thing, something that means things are going right. More crying = more better, to editorialize a little. This is far from wrong, of course. Crying is definitely healthy, and more importantly, trying to suppress crying is probably a bad idea, especially if you do it over and over.\n\nLet's take a look at the other extreme: what if someone decided to try and fit as much crying into each day as humanly possible? That seems wrong, doesn't it? So, there's an amount of crying that is healthy, and there's a smaller amount of crying that's unhealthy, and a larger amount of crying that's also unhealthy.\n\nI think your expectation of what constitutes a healthy amount of crying is based on past experience. \"I used to always be someone who cried easily\" – implying that crying easily is the \"correct\" thing to do. That's not universally true, of course: some people cry less and others cry more and still neither has to be wrong. Some people cry more and then less, some people cry less and then more. None of that needs to be unhealthy. It can be, especially if there's suppression or \"forcing\" involved... but what if there isn't?\n\nFrom what I've read, you have found a way to be supportive of the crying, which is a good thing. And then, with absolutely zero pressure or suppressing, the urge to cry goes away. Maybe that just means that the urge wasn't what you thought it was? Maybe you've already \"cried away\" most of what there was to cry, so only traces of it came up this time, and just giving those traces the space they needed was all that your mind really needed. So, the urge passed.\n\nI think if you simply assume that the urge to cry always needs to lead to crying, you're actually applying a very subtle kind of force to get yourself to cry more than you really need. To put it more bluntly, you might be teaching yourself that you need to cry for things to get better. But is that really how it works? I think it's a little more nuanced: letting the crying happen to the extent it wants to happen will tend to improve things and create more resolution. Extending the crying to beyond what is actually there is the equivalent of singing sad songs in the rain when you feel down... to use a strong word: wallowing. That's not *exactly* what \"I love crying\" is, but doesn't it go in the same general direction if you look at it in a certain way?\n\nWhat if you simply accepted it when the urge to cry goes away, if you applied zero pressure in that direction? Knowing that if any crying needs to happen in the future, it still will. This is not about removing crying, after all, it's about letting things happen to the exact rate and extent that is natural, no more and no less. And sometimes, that will be less, and sometimes it will be more.",

The best way to deal with confusion is being okay with it and just waiting for things to settle, knowing that they *will...* and you don't even have to do anything to make it happen. Your mind does so many things for you in the background: you don't have to think about how to build grammatically correct sentences by picking from a pool of tens of thousands of words in just the right sequence, you just *do it*. The mind does all the heavy lifting and you can't even see it happen. Many other things work in the exact same way, and confusion gets resolved in the same way too, you just have to get out of the way. There's no need to figure everything out consciously. Trust your mind to help you figure things out in the background. It will come.\n\nIn any case, you don't have to make any far-reaching decisions just yet. Maybe in a while you'll feel comfortable with making some small changes, maybe there will be some sudden big realizations, who knows. You don't have to rush it or force it.\n\nQuite a few years ago, I had a transformation a bit like that, and fortunately I just naturally let this process happen without really worrying too much about figuring everything out. So, I can tell you from experience that \"doing nothing\" will help things settle. Make decisions and changes when they feel right, and don't focus so much on them until then. At some point, something *will* feel right.\n\nAll the best!",

    "text": "Positive affirmations are not straightforward to do right. A lack of feelings isn't even in the top 5 of common mistakes, as far as I'm concerned. Either way there's no point in faking feelings, so you might as well simply go with mechanical positive affirmations and see if anything starts changing over a couple of weeks.\n\nThe biggest pitfall with positive affirmations is if they conflict with your thinking. If you affirm to yourself \"I am confident\" but you don't think you're confident, that thought will come up while you repeat the affirmation and basically completely neutralize it. For getting actual results, it's much more useful to get creative with affirmations so that there's no conflict in thinking. For instance, \"I am confident\" can be 'weakened' into \"I feel confident\" which can be weakened into \"I've felt confident in the past and I can feel confident again\" (if you remember imagining confidence, that qualifies as feeling confident in the past!) which can be weakened into \"I can imagine what confidence feels like\" which can be weakened into \"I wonder what confidence feels like\" (in a vaguely positive/speculative way, rather than a frustrated way). Finding something you don't really fundamentally disagree with will do more for you than any other \"trick\" surrounding positive affirmations. Over time, the goalposts will shift.\n\nAll of this sort of opposes mindfulness, in a way, because mindfulness is pretty much the opposite of trying to control your mind... but I hope this helps answer your question. Practicing mindfulness will, over time, make your feelings more accessible, so that's certainly relevant too.",

A marathon runner can go for an hour long walk and explain it as \"relaxing\" while a sedentary person can do the same and risk hamstring/ankle injuries, joint/muscle pain or trigger restless leg syndrome. It is important to do stretching exercises to really get the blood flowing before and after. Also I can't describe how much foam rolling helps. You pretty much kneed the misfiring nerves in your muscles into submission. I assure you exercising, (even just walks) is tremendously beneficial for sleep and mental health, we just have to be a little smart about it. You can read the book \"spark\" to get a deeper appreciation of it.",

I tell myself that I probably suck or I’m not good enough. Those kind of thoughts. \n\nBut what I’ve learnt from my therapy session, is that it’s okay to still want validation. But when I don’t get them, can I still speak kindly to myself? Can I tell myself, “hey that’s okay. You did your best.” Or “they don’t agree with you, but that doesn’t mean you’re worthless.”  I guess in other words, we fall back to us validating ourselves. \n\nUnfortunately, I think if needing validation is our pattern, it might stick for a while.

I don’t try “fix” or “change” that about me cause I feel like I’m just sweeping something I crave for under the rug - and that’s not good either. \n\nWho knows if I learn to accept myself this way, one day I can reach a point when I really dgaf? Haha. It’s an ongoing journey. \n\nWhat happens when you don’t get validations from others? How would you feel?",

    "text": "I'm a little surprised that *nobody* has answered yet. So, I guess you'll have to make do with my answer.\n\nFirst off, these are the most difficult conditions for learning to deal with something: when it's a big problem for you and no way to really escape it. So, it might take a while and there might be a decent amount of frustration to work through for you. It's totally possible to do, though.\n\nFor this, though, based on what you've written, I think you might have to level up your approach to mindfulness a little. You say that in tough moments, you have to focus on your body sensations to halt thought spirals. That can be effective, but it's not the be-all and end-all of mindfulness. The true goal is to allow the thoughts to do their thing, and keeping just enough distance so that you're not preventing them from happening but also not encouraging them. It takes a while to become able to strike this balance, and I think the same kind of balance is the best way to deal with your noise situation. Let's dive in a little more.\n\nWhat makes this kind of thing difficult to deal with is that you have the immediate \"learned\" mental reaction to the noise, and on top of that you also have a bunch of thoughts and feelings about that, and maybe a few more layers on top. So, the noise might bring up an immediate feeling of annoyance, then some thoughts about how much it sucks that this keeps happening, perhaps anger at those people who don't seem to care about your peace of mind, maybe some frustration with yourself that this is bothering you so much, etc. etc.\n\nThe more of this kind of stuff you've got going on, the more likely it is that your thoughts and feelings will start circling around one or more of these aspects, and if your mind is going in circles, that can go on for quite a bit. Hypothetically, if you broke out of the circles, the feelings would fade fairly quickly. In practice, though, I guess most people try to stop the circle by distracting themselves (like you seem to be doing, focusing on your body in an attempt to \"crowd out\" the thoughts), but there tends to be a tendency for them to still kind of ping-pong back and forth between that and all the extra feelings and thoughts \"about\" the noise. This results in the focus on the body kind of getting associated with the frustration etc. to some extent, making it hard to fully break out of that.\n\nThere is only one solution that I know of: instead of trying to distract yourself, commit to letting all of the thoughts and feelings happen, and all you have to do is \"be in mindfulness mode\". In other words, stay aware of what's happening inside your mind. Make no attempt to change the thoughts and feelings, no attempt to stop them, also no deliberate stoking the flames. If it seems like you could actively follow the thoughts instead of just observing them, don't actively follow. Anything that comes up automatically... let it happen, same rules: no stopping it, no encouraging it.\n\nThis can be quite frustrating because it means that not only do you have to let your immediate reaction to the noise happen, but also all of the following reactions, which might seem counter-productive and maybe even hard to make sense of in terms of how you'd do it. I think it's really just about adopting the right mindset that helps you observe without getting in the way. Here's how I think about it, maybe this will inspire you to find a good way of thinking for yourself.\n\nThe common way people frame it is that you are not your thoughts and feelings etc., and I feel like that's not so easy to fully understand unless you've already had the big realization that the people who use this description have already gotten to. Hence, the way I put it is that the vast majority of thoughts and feelings are *habits*, automatic programs of sorts (even though it often doesn't feel that way, probably be cause we tend to think that thinking is always a conscious and deliberate thing): through repetition your mind has become \"trained\" to rehash the same thoughts and feelings in the same situation.\n\nThis is a natural process and it can be supremely useful because it makes lots of useful thoughts and feelings much easier for you to have: it just happens! In some cases, though, the mind \"learns\" thoughts and feelings that aren't so helpful. The key insight in mindfulness is that if you treat all these automatic thoughts and feelings as \"echoes from the past\", and don't take them to mean anything in particular, then just giving them time and space to play out to their conclusion will start letting the mind re-process everything they are based on, and this will usually lead to the mind finding a new way of responding to the situation. If we naturally never really engaged with these thoughts and feelings and also didn't attempt to stop them, we'd actually stop having a large range of problems! Maybe you've had this happen with some minor annoyance: you noticed it but it didn't really seem like a big deal so you just let the feeling do its thing, and then it simply disappeared. It's easy to do this with small issues as they come up for the first time... and it's also easy to obsess over small issues long enough to turn them into big issues. That's what mindfulness is \"designed\" to reverse, because the same approach still works for bigger issues, it just takes more patience and the right attitude.\n\nThe closest I have in my personal experience is some issues I have with something vaguely similar to tinnitus. It comes and goes, some days it's there a lot and some days there's nothing, so the situation isn't entirely comparable. Still, at times it was extremely annoying, not least because it could get quite intense and it had just enough moment-by-moment variation in it that it was very hard to get used to it. When I started understanding that I needed to let all of those mental responses happen, at first nothing changed. Then I started being a bit less frustrated with myself for not being able to shrug it off. Then it started bothering me a bit less. I still get bothered by it sometimes, especially when I'm trying to sleep, but I've started being able to sleep even while it was happening (totally unthinkable before I began changing my approach, I had to use sound masking tricks to be able to sleep at all), at least some of the time.\n\nSo, extrapolating to your situation: even if you do everything right, chance are you will still have more frustration and annoyance at times even after things have started getting better... and it will take a while for things to start getting better in a way that is actually recognizable as \"better\". Trust in the process, let all of the echoes from the past happen. When it gets to be too much, go back to whatever coping strategies you have now (distraction etc.), and come back to the mindfulness approach later when you've recovered a little. Each time you \"put in\" some true mindfulness will help a bit, and it will add up over time. You'll just have to trust me on this and stick with it long enough to get there.\n\nIf you have any more questions or anything else you want to talk about, let me know!",

    "text": "I don't fully understand how the content of your post relates to the title, but I'll try and answer anyway.\n\nInterpreting feelings is a tricky business. Feelings are *meant* to be messengers from your mind to let you know something needs attention. If you feel bad about something, that might mean that you need to change something. So, it's totally understandable that you'd start wondering if maybe you need a different job.\n\nOn the other hand, some people end up switching jobs over and over because it always feels bad. This is a trickier situation because that's not really sustainable, right? And then maybe you could argue that the feeling is not helping you if you take it at face value. At that point, traditionally one would start thinking about counselling or even therapy.\n\nNow, once you realize that you've tried \"solving\" a feeling over and over but it's just not working, it's easier to realize that something else needs to happen... but if you're getting the feelings and haven't tried to address them in the most obvious way yet, it's hard to tell if you're interpreting the feelings correctly, right? Maybe you truly *are* in the wrong job, but it could just as easily be something else about the situation that is creating the stress and mess... maybe something job-*related*, maybe something else entirely.\n\nI've spent years and years trying to understand my feelings. Some of them seemed silly but they still kept coming up... which quickly leads to thoughts like \"is there something wrong with me?\" or just various other self-doubt type things. What I realized at some point is that analyzing feelings simply doesn't work. Feelings are not a conscious thing, so most of what's behind them is invisible to me, and any analysis will be based on stuff that I *think* is related. I have no idea of knowing what the feeling really means... all I have is my thoughts about it, and nothing tells me that they're correct. They might seem logical, but that's very different from me knowing for certain what's going on in the background.\n\nThis ties into the notion in mindfulness that it's useful to not judge your thoughts and feelings: for one thing, feeding negativity (or even positivity) into thoughts and feelings tends to reinforce them (your mind basically goes: this is getting a lot of mental \"charge\", so it must be important, let's do it more)... but on top of that, *believing* things about your thoughts and feelings also gives them more permanence.\n\nThe aim of mindfulness is to let the mind go through thoughts and feelings with no interference. No stopping them, no encouraging them, no trying to argue with them or change them, just observe them and see what happens to them. If you manage this, invariably they will end at some point (typically after 30 seconds to two minutes), and something else will come. That something else might be related, or it might not. In either case, letting that next thing happen in the same way will let it play out to its end too... and so on. Our normal habits of trying to distract ourselves, or argue with thoughts and feelings, or wallow in them (woe is me etc.), or trying to force them to stop, all of that interferes with happens if the mind can work through them uninterrupted. When we use mindfulness to fully let it happen, the mind gets an opportunity to start \"re-processing\" the thoughts and feelings, which means they'll start fading or turning into something different (usually something better, because without interference the mind is actually very good at fixing problems). Frequently a change like this is accompanied by a \"light bulb\" moment, but it doesn't have to be. Sometimes things just change slowly, invisibly, for the better, and you don't even  realize that some issue is gone until a few weeks (or months!) later.\n\nMindfulness isn't about just stopping bad feelings and following good feelings. It's about learning to let the mind do its job without trying to \"help\" it (which is usually misguided because we have no idea what's going on in the first place).\n\nWhat makes it hard is that all of us have extremely strong habits of trying to actively do things to deal with difficult thoughts and feelings. If you feel frustrated at your lack of progress dealing with something, it's hard to stop yourself from going into \"fix-it mode\"... and even if you don't, you'll tend to try and stop the feeling of frustration because surely feeling frustrated is \"bad\", right? In mindfulness it isn't. It just is. It's another thing we need to give the mind space to re-process. All of the extra thoughts and feelings on top of the actual thing, anything that comes up almost by itself, can't be consciously changed. By using mindfulness, you give the mind all its needs to start working through the appropriate changes: a bit of time and no getting in the way. Initially that's hard to keep up, but even just two seconds will start making a difference, and over time it will tend to get easier.\n\nI've found that when I manage to do this long enough over some time, feelings will start to transform. I might just stop feeling stressed out about something, or I'll start realizing out of the blue something about the whole situation or about myself that I never noticed before, making it much easier for me to really understand what I needed to do (if anything). Since this kind of outcome is impossible to predict, I find that the less I try to \"push\" for any particular outcome in mindfulness, the better. This is why I said \"observe to see what happens to it\" – there's no knowing what kind of change will happen, and no knowing what kind of change would work the best. Trust your mind to figure it out, if you give it what it needs.\n\nAre persistent feelings part of life? Probably, yes. But any given feeling might not have to *keep* being part of life. Time (and mindfulness) will tell.",

It's something I've been working on the last couple years and I feel like I've made a lot of progress. Definitely still have my moments, but I'm quicker to realign.\n\nFor me? It involved disengaging from all social media (this is all I have left), not consuming negative content, reading the news... etc. Following subreddits that are more uplifting, not engaging in negative threads. If you feel like you're about to write a negative comment, dont... flip it into something positive instead, even if you don't necessarily believe it. Or go to a more positive post and insert a happy comment there. As someone else said above, you can definitely start with the content you're engaging with on Reddit. The more negative content you consume, the shittier you will feel.  It's okay to not agree with something or not be happy about something you see, but a great way to start is just learning how to not engage in a negative way. Just click off that awful post and move onto to something else for a moment. \n\nAnother thing that can be helpful is a gratitude app to help you focus on more positive things in life.

Blissful, exhilarating happiness is not something we can sustain long term, and if you were that happy when a loved one died people would think you're psychotic!\n\nFor me, I've been having good results focusing on accepting what happens to me. Being content with the way things are at the moment, and not dwelling on how they should be different. I still make rational choices and actions to get the outcome I want in the future, but I've let go of thoughts and feelings like:\n\n\"If this person had just prepared properly they wouldn't need my help right now\"\n\"Can't this person see a line behind them, they're moving so slow\"\n\nBy letting go of those thoughts when they pop up, I find myself having an easier time not letting things bother me, and I'm just in a better mood as I navigate the world.\n\nI can appreciate your apprehension to being \"happy,\" if that means being lame and self centered to you. Those people certainly exist. But I'd like to suggest that you could still make informed decisions, move towards your goals, and see the world in a realistic way without mental suffering. And for me, letting go of judgemental thoughts when they come up has led to increased contentment, and every now and then a little shot of happiness",

When you say \"brain\" to people, they have a very rigid definition of what the brain is and they can show you a picture of it. But when it comes to the word \"mind\" people can't seem to describe it or point to it.\n\nAnd it's the perfect word because when you look deeply into it for yourself, it's not really there. Just like when you think deeply about your thoughts, you'll find they are also not really there. We often say that thoughts come from the mind. But of course you can't see the mind, it has no physical existence, so where do these thoughts come from?",

With her, maybe use this to find a different way to communicate, as more questions, listen and be supportive. \n\nFor her sounds like this could be a lesson in moderation and self control. Abstinence is often the answer for people who have a true problem, which it sounds like she might have a problem, but I’m not a professional and I don’t know enough, only what you’ve brought up in this post. \n\nI personally do not think substances are inherently bad, but I also believe that they can tend to be a trap on the path of spirituality and mindfulness-Spotlighting your desires, insecurities and self.\n\nYou guys are going to have to have a different type of conversation than you have in the past, one driven by unconditional love and compassion, free of judgement. I also recommend you do some work on your codependency(not in a rude way, just as much as this is bothering your mental health… I would say there is some underlying codependency issues there)\n\nI hope this helps, and remember that the most important thing you can do is love.",

No, eliminate these emotions on which a toxic life is built. Awaken the ego, eliminate anger, hate, revenge, jealousy, pride, greed and selfishness.

I mean we think about things that we have some sort of attachment to. Smells, feelings, touch, sight, are things our brain has gather intelligence about since we were born. Like a vaccine, we give our bodies a weak version of the  germ so we remember how to fight it off. The next time we come across our brain sends a single “hey remember this?” I feel like somehow that connects to observing something, our brain searching past intel on it, which creates a thought. The reasoning as to why you thought could be infamous. It could be intel stored in your subconscious. Which is why I heard thought journals are helpful. You write down something and explore the reasoning why. Same with feelings. Hope that makes sense 😂",

To me, bluntly, meditation then just becomes a more peaceful way of being as deluded as one is off the cushion.\n\nThe important thing in meditation is the 'state', not thoughts. Thoughts ruin the state. The desired state is one of peace and stillness, of just being kind to yourself, open to the present moment. When a thought comes in, return to a focus on the breath to return to that 'state' of stillness. Then, with a consistent practice, the brain begins to rewire itself to make getting into these states of stillness easier, and the stillness starts to filter into life off the cushion.",

    "text": "Hope you don't mind me butting in.\n   \nMay I ask why you want to feel less guilty?\n    \nFeeling guilty is a good thing. People who are being good, often feel guilty when they fall short of their expectations of themselves causing some unwanted consequences.\n    \nI don't know about you, but I am sensitive, and often feel things very strongly, so I can imagine feeling wracked by guilt over this. And for me, the only way out is through. I have to feel the guilt, and allow that to be my silver lining. \n     \nFeeling wounded or emotionally/spiritually sore is appropriate and healthy in the aftermath of even an innocent honest mistake which hurts others. It's not required all the time, and it being so strong it's becoming a problem, sounds like a problem. But the guilt itself, feeling it, uncomfortably, being distressed, that's all normal.\n    \nSo let me just address one maladaptive type of guilt. Which is a sort of self-flagellating guilt. One of feeling bad to pay penance or make up for or pay for what you did. That's not healthy, and I would advise you seek help to find other ways of thinking about yourself and the world that don't transact pain for moral absolution. That's a system of control spread by institutions, and not a spiritually holistic way to spread kindness, love, and joy.\n     \nThe guilt is there so that you know that you would never do this on purpose, and to motivate you to reflect on whether there was anything you could have done differently or any lessons to be learned.\n    \nAs time goes on, try to let that process happen. Journaling by hand helps, as I can attest and science supports. If you're getting stuck and having trouble moving on, then you need more help than some advice from a stranger. You need  someone to talk to in person.\n   \nI'm not saying a therapist necessarily -- someone you can trust, who is compassionate and has a calming reassuring presence to you. Could be anyone. \n   \nSometimes, what we need is confirmation from someone else that we've done our due diligence to be a good person that we can take as permission to move on.",

It helps also to try to find where the guilt is in your body -- shoulders or neck are common, for example but anywhere at sll from soles of the feet to the crown of the head or fingertips are possible. Often it helps to welcome the sensation in the body and explore this question that way -- treating that location as though that's where the answer lies.",

If this intention is not there then what will happen is that our usual deluded and harmful patterns will simply take over and run the show.\n\nI'd just consider disregarding notions of control or not control altogether as they're not very helpful at all.

Overthinking is a symptom that we have beliefs that did serve us, at some point, but don’t serve us anymore. The more beliefs I uncover, the less overthinking I noticed. Keep in mind that the process can be uncomfortable because of the false protection these beliefs project but it is much better on the other side.

    "text": "One of the things that helped loosen my relationships with addiction was noticing its unsatisfactory nature. Even as I was doing it in the end it wasn't really that satisfying, the pleasure was perceived as very limited and was not tied to any deeper sense of fulfillment or purpose. Even as I was doing it there was a lot of agitation and suffering. ''It's a hollow and empty pursuit, and I'd rather be doing something else, really'', is what I began to think after a while.\n\nCan you maybe begin to see this, without the usual self-judging? Think in terms of reducing not abandoning. In terms of introducing and nurturing new ways of seeing this issue, not about changing your whole mind overnight.\n\nI'd recommend you to start a mindfulness practice and to connect to presence during your day too as much as possible, without burning out. This awareness will facilitate everything else.",

The one constant is that you still have the ability to try and be better, but as we get older we often let that skill fade. This is often because we “think” we need to put our energies to the continual added responsibilities instead of sticking with the more important priority of trying to be better. \n\nDon’t forget that trying to be better (in any number of ways) should remain our strongest skill and at the top of our priority list.

You could say that was childlike.\n\n  \nChildren also don't hold emotions in like we do, so becoming more like a child can also mean not hiding your anger with someone, but instead letting it flow.",

Listen to your body's complaints, explore where it hurts, and where it doesn't.  Accept that this is how you feel right now. \n\nYou could try doing a body scan meditation, where you focus on each little part of your body in turn. Get comfortable and take some deep relaxing breaths. Choose a starting point, and check in with the part, what do you feel there? Think about and appreciate what it does for you, let it know your doing your best to take care of it (or will do better, if you know how). Imagine your breath flowing into and out of the area as you focus on it. Depending on your pain level, it might be hard to focus on anything else, and that's fine. You could just focus on that if you need to. But focusing on other parts may provide a bit of relief, if the pain isn't too bad.\n\nMy husband has a trick (for localized headaches, but might work for other things) where he imagines a sort of barrier around the pain, and holds it there. Every time the pain ebbs you try to tighten the boarder and shrink the area. In a way it feels like it's counter to mindfulness or acceptance, but I think you do have to be mindful and accepting that this is what's happening before you can try to control it. I've not been as successful with it as he has, and it only helps as long as you hold your concentration, but something to try anyway. Good luck",

    "text": "I’m confused by the language of this post and why OP, as a hetero man, is asking to reduce sexual desire “especially” toward women. Seems redundant? Why not just ask about reducing sexual desire, *period*?\n\nAnyway, my thought is that meditation helps me be more aware of craving and aversion and supports responding to those cravings and aversions more intentionally. In responding more intentionally, I strengthen my ability to respond intentionally. I meditate again and again, respond to craving and aversion intentionally again and again, and the craving and aversion has less and less power.\n\nBut it’s easy to slip back into craving and aversion. Much easier to slip back than it was to make the progress. So it’s not perfect, it’s not one and done. It’s not like you get to the next level and are forever safe from those cravings and aversions that plagued you before. \n\nSo it helps to make friends with them, like Buddha inviting Mara to tea. Because the harder you push Mara away, the more powerful Mara gets.\n\n“Mara,” you say instead, “my companion, sexual desire, you are welcome here. You are welcome here, but I cannot let you stoke the fire. I know you sometimes cannot help but to burn down the house when you get too close to the hearth. But you may sit with me and have tea.”\n\nAnd maybe someday, Mara doesn’t creep so close to the fire. Maybe someday, Mara doesn’t stay so long and you don’t have to be so exhaustingly vigilant.",

The problem is that a lot of the methods and techniques will likely increase your arousal and libido. \n\nYou can use Tantric practices to draw that energy and focus inward, but learning that from a Reddit thread is not as effective as doing preliminary research online and looking for an actual guide. \n\nSo, you wouldn't reduce or eliminate the sexual attraction, but you would channel that energy and focus to deepen your meditation and use it for creative pursuits. \n\nIf this is caused by some trauma or addiction, though, you may want to get a professional assessment to see what treatment modalities are available. If you're experiencing moderate to severe mental health disorders, advanced meditation practices should NOT be the first option you consider.",

It's that mindfulness/meditation is a portal to the Self. What you realize there is much greater than focusing your attention and being productive. \n\nYou're basically using a jet to go visit your neighbour down the street. See, if you have \"knowledge\" of the Self, then your ladder will always be pointing in the right direction. Whereas by jumping straight into concentration and will, you will never know if what you're doing is right. And that doubt grinds your life to a miserable state of constant guessing. \n\nPractice a little longer, no hurry to become a guru. It will serve you immensely. Cheers!",

    "text": "Your friend might be reading a little more into it than strictly reasonable.\n\nThat you feel annoyed is a sign that there's still *something*, but that doesn't mean you're still \"stuck on it\". Our thoughts and feelings are sort of like small building blocks. Resolving a chunk of old thoughts and feelings somewhere gets rid of a lot of clutter but not necessarily all the additional thoughts and feelings that are \"next to\" that chunk. In a way, with us being human, it's unlikely we'll ever be \"perfectly healed\"... but sometimes all there is is some small thing. Maybe it's a small thing that's connected to a completely different larger thing... but who knows? If there is something else, it will come up eventually. If there isn't, it won't... unless you start actively looking for what you *think* might be there, which tends to create it. Some people get \"addicted\" to \"healing\" so that they feel like there always needs to be some new big to work through... and with that expectation, big things will keep coming. Your mind creates what you look for.\n\nSo... does the presence of that feeling of annoyance mean everything else is still there? Probably not. Does feeling annoyed serve you? Unlikely. Can you resolve whatever that's about? Probably. Will it change the way you deal with that person in the future? Maybe.\n\nDon't read too much into thoughts and feelings. Be mindful of them, stay that little essential bit disconnected from them and see where that takes you. That's all there is to it. Any worrying and wondering about the past is mostly a waste of time. I think that if you want to think about things, it's usually more revealing if you consider possible ways in which things might change. For instance: if you were no longer annoyed at the person, and just felt sort of neutral about them while still remembering perfectly well what happened in the past, how do you think that might change the choices you make when interacting with them? It's not a question you might be able to come up with a definitive answer to, but it keeps you moving... as opposed to second-guessing yourself, which usually doesn't.",

The term “monkey mind” comes from meditation—it refers to how our thoughts can jump around restlessly, like a monkey swinging from branch to branch. It’s about that inner chatter we all experience.\n\nAlso, “Chango” (which means monkey) has been a longtime nickname in my family, so I’ve always had a soft spot for monkeys. I often try to explore themes of mindfulness and spirituality in my work, so it all sort of came together in this piece :)",

Loving awareness just holds all of it. But sometimes what’s needed is more than mindfulness, awareness or whatever you want to call it. Sometimes we need active compassion, loving kindness, connection, or even therapy, medication or support groups. Awareness isn’t a silver bullet I’m afraid. Make sure you use all of your resources and find what works for you. It’s a process and it takes time. Hang in there please, you are worth it!",

You see, the mind is a great wanderer and it was left for too long astray. Now, it has to brought back to its rightful place of awareness. If you want to end suffering, consider this.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment which will keep off those intrusive thoughts. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity, social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you're aware of yourself too, and not only surroundings.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of yourself and thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

    "text": "To give you a quick tip and keep it short, choiceless awareness. (Look up that and Krishnamurti)\n\nThis is the middle way that's so often talked about between internally fighting those memories and thoughts and running away from them. You could say between your overthinking and your avoidance in all its nasty forms. It's very much like meditation but right where you are, whatever you are feeling, thinking or otherwise experiencing.\n\n-End of the short bit-\n\nThe middle way is being present with the thoughts and the fears and the feelings of hopelessness you probably have. That's super hard admittedly. But you can compare it to if you had a sad and anxious kid and you just sit with them to be there and listen to them. Without giving advice, without giving solutions or distractions. Let it sit, cry, feel bad, feel utterly hopeless. But allowed to do so and supported by you. Mindfully \"detached\" or at a distance some call it. Can you imagine what that could be like? Maybe try it?\n\nDoing it is a little tricky to explain but it obviously involves mindfulness. No doubt there are guided mediations too. It helps to know how to meditate and steer or rest attention, keeping it broad, open and accepting/allowing of these negative sensations you feel. [Insert bus metaphor here]\n\nThere are a couple of components to it the way I came to it. It involved lots of old painful memories too. Stuff that makes me want to give up, as does the coping style of rumination you're focusing on here. But there are always a few more and they all have a root cause. I'm sure you can imagine. Therapy can be very helpful for this.\n\nImagine if you had a kid who felt like that, then the strict parent telling them they're not doing enough and the strict parent telling them that they should be punished for being like this. What happens then is that certain protectors step in to shield the kid by coping with things like rumination or avoidance. That's a circle, do you see? Something happens, you feel bad, you don't want to feel bad, you try to fix by coping with grappling or avoidance (rumination being one of those), now that happens, you feel worse, you don't want to, more coping, etc. \n\nThat circle can start to break when you ***allow*** yourself to feel for a moment. Having a stable ground in knowing how to rest attention on the breath or any activity or sense helps greatly, so mindfulness.",

    "text": "You can't stop thinking but thoughts can slow down when you stop entertaining them by not engaging in those thoughts. Easier said than done? There is a way.\n\nMindfulness, in simple term is none other than awareness already inherent in us and our real nature, a natural state of Being. It is called mindfulness due to constant disruptive thoughts which mindfulness supposed to keep off those intrusive thoughts. So, various practices are being prescribed. But in my view awareness cannot be practiced any more than breathing is not being practiced after we're cut off from umbilical cord. Awareness is as natural as that, our natural state of Be-ing, just BE. Now, consider this.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity, social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you are aware of yourself too, and not only of surroundings.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

I have not tried to be present and in the moment at all times, as I am like you, I enjoy being up in my head thinking abstract thoughts, planning, reminiscing, mulling, etc. But when my abstract thinking turns into anxiety, negativity, dread, anger, regret, etc. I am able to \"snap out of it\" and eject myself from that negative universe I have created in my head. I \"snap out of it\" by redirecting my attention to the present and in the moment and not up in the \"you're not good enough\" story that my mind had created.  From there, once I am back to being present, I can start again only now I can continue to be in the moment or maybe begin thinking abstractly again but in a more positive way. I can even encourage positive thoughts by being in nature, or opening my gaze to take in the skyline, or practicing gratitude.  This process repeats itself and I am never going to be rid of the negative thoughts but now I have a technique that I know works and reveals the \"truth\" that I am okay, safe, and not \"less than\" or whatever else my mind sometimes conjures up.

    "text": "Mindfulness-awareness is  the only thing really worth having. Without it one lives in a dream like state on auto- pilot in psychic sleep lost in thoughts and daydreams of the past and future but never here, now, present moment, missing out on the Reality of existence. You said it yourself when you're watching something you still losing yourself in thoughts therefore, you're not really watching or listening only through the screen of thoughts. That's the nature of the wandering mind which disrupts mindfulness-awareness.\n\nMindfulness, in simple term is none other than awareness already inherent in us and our real nature, a natural state of Being. It is called mindfulness due to constant disruptive thoughts which mindfulness supposed to keep off those intrusive thoughts. So, various practices are being prescribed. But in my view awareness cannot be practiced any more than breathing is not being practiced after we're cut off from the umbilical cord. Awareness is as natural as that, our natural state of Be-ing, just BE. Now, consider this.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity, social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you are aware of yourself too, and not only of surroundings.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

Don’t be afraid to seek help from others, we are social creatures and should lean on others in times of crisis. Rumination, like in your case, can be easily undone in the matter of a week with the proper treatment. It will allow you to conquer your thoughts, and to move on. And this is 2025, not 1925. Don’t feel as though you have to “deal with it” alone, or that it’ll go away by itself. Your mental health is incredibly important, because at the end of the day, your mind is how you see the world (and yourself).\n\nYou can try meditating as well. Before you fall to sleep, relax your whole body, and imagine putting all your worries into a box. Lock up that box, keep it closed, and feel the peace of just being you. And it is in that moment when you are truly in the present, not depressed about the past or anxious about the future. You will suddenly realize that you are not your thoughts :)",

You can’t cry if you’re drinking lol. Follow that by a couple deep breaths, paying attention to the tightness in my chest and talking kindly to myself “it’s okay, we can get through this.”  Sometimes I’ll imagine giving myself a hug or a back rub. It sounds silly but it helps. Or I’ll put an earbud on and listen to music and really just focus my thoughts and energy on that. \n\nI just want you to know you’re not alone and your feelings are valid.

Some of these bumps are also passed on through generations, so it would be better to say that your being of suffering is an offspring of all of your ancestors' suffering.\n\nThat being of suffering that wants to complain, nag, feel victimized, feel excluded, unable to achieve, less than everyone, small, mediocre, struggling, confused and so on and so forth doesn't like the idea of not existing.\n\nSo it's going to grab the negative definition \"absence of suffering,\" which is rather an implicit way of accepting the limits of our language, and make it into something concrete. It turns the negative definition into a positive one.\n\nIt takes that definition literally and says \"Oh, you want to be dead inside\" Or something along those lines.\n\nOne imagines at this point the figure of a silent and forbidding Buddhist monk meditating with dead eyes.\n\nBut those monks are smiling softly when they meditate. And when they finish meditating they seem very energized and very happy. So something's not adding up here.\n\nMaybe \"absence of suffering\" was more like the finger pointing at the moon and our mind turned it from a pointer into a reference object.",

Also forgiveness and acting lovingly and gracefully in situations where it’s difficult to do so is very rewarding, i know it feels unfair like why would you forgive someone like this, but leaving these types of people to the universe/god is so much easier and it’ll leave you weightless, try making reasons as to why they’re acting like this, instead of saying “i deserve better than this, why are they treating me miserably” tell yourself “i wonder what they had to go through in life and what parts of themselves they had to abandon to become this mean and lack emotional intelligence.. poor souls :(“, remember it’s your heart, they will not feel the hatred you feel for them, only you will feel it. \n\nLastly some tips: when i got an experience like this i lit a candle and read psalms 109 and 35 (avoiding the parts that are negatively self talking) and i’m not Christian but words hold power especially when said out loud and with intention, and a great mindset to have is a kill them kindness mindset, they try to get a bad reaction out of you and you are out here being loving.",

It’s about being aware of what your thoughts are, and by being aware, we can determine if these thoughts are harmful to us or helpful. If harmful, then we can take action to change what we are thinking about. \n\nIn the early stages, our minds will quickly return to the thoughts that come easy to us, often times these are the harmful, beat yourself up thoughts. We just have to stay mindful and continue to return ourselves to more positive thoughts or even just neutral, like our breath. \n\nWhen I put in the effort to do this, I realized it paid off. I was in a more calm state than I would have been if I let my thoughts do their typical snowball into, for example, hating myself. \n\nBecause of the success, it was easier, easier but not easy, to remember for the next situation. As I continued this, it started becoming more natural to catch negative thinking early, switch my thoughts, and stay more positive for longer periods of time. \n\nI’m new to mindfulness but wow has it ever been game changing for me.

Mindfulness doesn’t necessarily make life **more exciting**, but it can make it **feel richer**, as if the ordinary things you once overlooked suddenly have depth.\n\nWhen you’re fully present, even simple experiences, feeling the sun's warmth, tasting food, listening to music, become more vivid. Instead of your mind constantly wandering, you experience things as they actually are, not just as passing thoughts.\n\nAt first, it might feel strange, but over time, mindfulness can help reduce that restless feeling of needing constant distractions. It doesn’t erase thoughts, but it helps you observe them without getting swept away.\n\nIs it worth it? For many people, yes. The moments where life feels dull or repetitive start feeling more meaningful, even if they don’t change on the surface.\n\nHope this helps a little!

The mind-thought is a useful  and necessary tool which works like a hammer, it can build or it can destroy and ought to be treated as such, a tool. But we don't call ourselves a hammer or a tool, do we? No, of course not. Similarly, it is with the mind which supposed to be a servant of ours and not a tyrannical master.\n\nWhat we are is awareness which is way above intellect. Awareness is Reality itself. The intellect being a useful tool and a servant can lead us to the door, but it cannot open the door for we hold the key, which is awareness.",

    "text": "This is a really common question and concern that a lot of people have.\n\nIt would seem to me to be the difference between non-discriminatory mindfulness with attachment versus non-discriminatory mindfulness with detachment .\n\nSo as long as we develop a relationship with detachment or a relationship with awareness of reality, as it actually is so awareness of reality, according to the three marks of existence , impermanence, no self, Suffering.\n\nThen it’s really difficult for people to take advantage of us .\n\nSo it’s not forgiveness without discernment and it’s a forgiveness that’s more non-so it’s more like openness and non-involvement with unnecessary attachment points in our own minds or in the outward environment .\n\nSo it’s kind of like a constant practice of stepping back and being aware and so when you are constantly stepping back and being aware, you’re grounded in the nature of awareness and you have your full faculties of discernment and self protection, etc. it’s just that you’re no longer falling into the wrong belief that there is actually a separate someone who’s doing something or who can be taken advantage of.\n\n\nIn this way, you can do whatever you like to do, but you do it without attachment, and this is a kind of natural protection .\n\nSo it’s like the difference between being convinced by everything or everything being a point for not being convinced and just being aware and then you can participate in a lot of exploration, experimentation and testing.",

He literally accepted a serial killer to be a monk, and whether or not that monk had enlightenment or lived in a particular way, most of us are the people of the city who heard about this very evil very negative person who is now become the monk and is following the Buddha and we wished for his death you know we wished for his punishment, but the Buddha didn’t see it like that, and he actually protected this monk and said that he changed his life and was Actually concerned now with the path.\n\nSo of course, they’re always some extreme examples but in general, we don’t respect monks as individuals. We respect what they represent, which is the path the robes of the Buddha and we learn to stop judging other people or making the idea in our mind of being the punisher or the judge, and actually we turn the mind around to take responsibility for our own practice .\n\nSo that’s my feeling on it",

Each day is like the first day and the last day of our life so bringing up that view of freshness is very important in dealing with the people that we are responsible for and care about.\n\nThere’s another Zen saying that might seem to be inconvenient but actually is a very joyful invitation for transformation and that is that if you don’t have enough time in your daily life to sit for 15 minutes a day and follow your breathing then you better sit for 30 minutes a day and follow your breathing.\n\nOK, so good luck and send my well wishes to your family and your children.",

You are simply *aware* of its presence.\n\nOne helpful way to move from being identified with the content of the thought is to begin by paying attention to its qualitative nature of thought itself: Is it about the past or the future? Pleasant or unpleasant? Fast or slow? Colorful or monochrome? Starting here can be a gentle step toward loosening the grip of absorption or “identification” with the thought.\n\nAnother helpful approach is to bring your attention into your body and anchor your focus there—whether it be the sensation of your feet on the floor or the feeling of the breath in your body. The goal here is not to *ponder* the sensation but to *immerse* yourself the feeling of it. The interesting thing about the body is that while your mind can be anywhere—caught in the past or anticipating the future—the body is always exactly where you are.",

For example, if you wash the dishes don’t think about tomorrow‘s tasks.\n\nStill, being mindful all the time is something that maybe the buddhas can achieve. The idea is to not resist your thoughts and not engage, I know that this is too abstract, in practice when you realise your mind wanders, just focus on your breathe.\n\nThe important thing here is to accept that it is ok your mind to wander, just bring it back.",

There are different frequencies out there but I use 528Hz frequency.\n\nMeditation is about sitting still and having NO racing next step thoughts. It's about being PRESENT IN THE MOMENT. \n\nSurfing used to be my therapy. Those giant waves forced me to forget about a failed relationship, office politics, apartment court case etc. I had to literally be in the present to navigate the waves crashing on me - survival out in rough surf conditions.\n\nNow that I don't live in a city near an ocean - I resort to salt baths and I try to practice mindfulness. I try to be in nature - just listening to the trees, birds, watching the butterflies.... there is some frequency out there that I am trying to tap into. Just that process itself is Meditation- connecting to nature - and understanding/ tapping into their instinct levels. \n\nI also use Vedic Astrology a lot. You don't have to be Hindu - but it helped me understand why my personality is such. I did consult an astrologer who was extremely sincere to explain how the planets are affecting me and how I need to learn to detach, and hone in on my natural gut instinct. \n\nIt's not that easy. But what is harder is to lose yourself to the everyday noise. Make your time YOUR TIME. Understand that we are all connected- everyone entered this plane of existence through different levels of consciousness. \n\nSome people are meant to learn and experience more - and others are meant to not dig deeper in their current physical form.\n\nYour soul has a purpose 🙏🏽",

    "text": "Some things to consider... where did you hear about mindfulness? If you heard about it from big names, eventually you can probably trace it to Buddhism.\n\nSo is your question, what does enlightenment mean in secular mindfulness thought, or Buddhist thought? What about enlightenment from a Hindu or Christian perspective, noting that the english term \"mindfulness\" is Christian?\n\nSecular thought generally tries to make enlightenment and mindfulness accessible. So enlightenment becomes just knowing what's happening right now, being in the moment. Among other things.\n\nBut in Buddhism, enlightenment is having an insight that is powerful enough that we abandon the cause of suffering, specifically as it arises in the framework of dependent origination. It is also a realization as to what the cessation of suffering actually is, on an experiential level.\n\nThat's a short answer, but it really helps to question where our ideas of \"mindfulness\" and \"enlightenment\" are coming from before we can find out what they actually refer to.",

These attachments lead to dissatisfaction and suffering.\n\nThe Third Noble Truth: The Truth of the End of Suffering (Nirodha):\nThis truth asserts that suffering can be overcome and that it is possible to reach a state of liberation, known as Nirvana, where there is no suffering.\n\nThe Fourth Noble Truth: The Truth of the Path to the End of Suffering (Magga):\nThis truth outlines the path, the Eightfold Path, which provides a practical framework for achieving the end of suffering. The Eightfold Path includes right understanding, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.\n\nhttps://thebuddhistcentre.com/buddhism/the-noble-eightfold-path\n\n“The Heart of the Buddhas teaching” written by Thich Nhat Hanh is a great start.\n\n\n\n“Rule your mind, or it will rule you”\n~ Buddha \n🙇🏻‍♂️🙏🏼🌺❤️",

But when thoughts become disturbing — for example you begin beating yourself up again over something from your past — you can stop dwelling in that negative thought bubble by returning to the present. You have an escape hatch when troubling thoughts begin to become your universe. And these thoughts often feel like reality — we become convinced that we are defective or broken, or that doom awaits us in the future and we are so immersed that it feels like “truth.”  Using mindfulness to first notice we’re immersed in a negative mindset and then using our mindfulness tools to return to present we can break that spell. Once present we can use our minds to remember that we are not broken at all, we just fall into negative thinking. Just knowing that we can break the power of all that negativity makes us less likely to fall into believing it.",

You know what you have done before and what you currently plan to do, but anything could happen between now and then. \n\nThinking of death and how I never know when it could be my last day (or my parents’ last day, etc.) kinda skips to the heart of the matter to snap me back to appreciating where I’ve made it to today - right where I am standing/sitting/walking/etc. - and it helps me to rest in the trust I have for myself, my ability to navigate whatever circumstances pop up next. \n\nStop anticipating what’s next bc you never know until it’s happening, just relax in knowing that you’ll handle it.

Awareness is as natural as that, our natural state of Be-ing, to just BE. Now, consider this.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity, social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you are aware of yourself too, and not only of surroundings.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

Do this in any position that's comfortable, and let your body move and adjust as you go. You can also have music or tv that relaxes you on in the background. Do this over and over and keep releasing any tensions you can.\n\nThis is a basic version of a fuller system.

    "text": "You have already received some great ideas on the meditation front.  Headspace is another app (albeit now a subscription) that has very good guided meditations both to get started and to help work with anxiety.  I would suggest it as an app worth exploring.  \n\nBut outside of an app you may find breath work, (which can be part of your meditation practice) to be provide some immediate relief for anxious moments.   I am very familiar with anxiety myself and you, I suspect based on your comments, also understand that an out of balance nervous system, with the sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system being over active even when threats do not exist is a big part of what generates your anxiety.   It is not your fault it is just a survival system that served us well in a different time and place when getting eaten by a lion was a more likely reality than it is today.   Breathing techniques like “box breath” where you breath in slowly for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, breath out for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds and then begin the cycle again - will I suspect bring things into balance for you with even a 5 min practice. \n\nIt is a form of meditation in itself or at a minimum a very complementary practice that you might find helpful to which ever of the other ideas you choose. \n\nIf I can make one suggestion I would strongly encourage you to find and listen to a podcast called Disordered (Anxiety Help) - it has been an incredible help to me and I would be very surprised if you don’t find yourself saying “that is me!!!!” As you listen to the two hosts, both are professional anxiety councillors who have dealt personally with debilitating anxiety I am very certain you will find other strategies that help you understand what your body and brain is doing that creates anxiety for you and also some very practical means of working with it / through it. \n\nEnjoy your path to more peace - I know that sense of urgency to find a solution - it is there for you!",

They're the ones that do enough of the failing that it takes to overcome the thing they can't do yet and eventually figure out how to do it.\n\nRead the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell if you'd like to know more about this topic.\n\nThis may be tough to hear, but you're giving up long before anyone could possibly become good at anything.\n\nAlso, question for you: Can you walk? It's probably the most difficult thing any of us learn to do in life. It takes a ton of practice and failing and trial and error and determination, and barring those of us with some kind of disability, we learn to do it before we can talk. Find something and approach it with that same determination and understanding that sucking at it is just part of the process and you will become good at it.

Try breaking them down into much smaller goals, and get tips from people who have had to learn how to do this, and didn't just have it come naturally to them.

    "text": "As it would. I'm sorry you're going through it. I hope you feel better soon.\n\nSomeone once said we could think of the word depress as deep rest. That you need deep rest from trying to be the identity that you think you ought to be because it's not working and it's exhausting and saps you of all your joy and energy.\n\nNotice, how, in that sentence, there is a \"You\" and an \"identity\". How they are two different things. Knowing this difference, SEEING it, realising it experientially, is the key.\n\nThis can be easier said than done. It's a subtle fluctuation of our minds, it's not material or matter like we usually try to observe and some of our minds may actively try to work against us as we try. All this to say, challenges are natural and part of the process but if you stick to it and you practice, it will become easy.\n\nIf you're introspective, you can try to notice how in your internal dialogue, there is always one part of you who is ALWAYS asking the questions and another part that ALWAYS answers. The part that asks is always the \"mind\" (of which identity is a subset) and the part of you that answers is always \"you\"\n\nAnd \"you\" is just awareness. It is literally, the faculty and ability to be conscious and aware. There is no object to \"be aware of\". Literally, the you that YOU ARE, is always and constantly and unceasingly aware because if you weren't, that's what we call death. You ARE aware all the time, have always been and will always be. You do not have to try to be aware, you simply have to realise that you are.\n\nI hope this helps. I am not a Buddhist monk. But I did learn what I know from someone who was a monk trained in meditation for ~7 years and I started learning 5.5 years ago myself. If that should tell you anything, it's that it's natural for these things to take time. There are no shortcuts, only experience and OP is both wise and experienced to wish you patience.",

It’s hard for me to sit still so this moving meditation has been a really good fit for me. I’m much older than you and wish that I’d found this practice when I was younger.

    "text": "You said you fail at 'everything' here, so that is a major statement and it is more likely that you have succeeded at doing at least some things. Like it could be that most of the major things that you have done as a whole have failed at least so far. But of course you will have succeeded at things within that or perhaps also at things that you might not currently see as important. Those successes are lessons learned, even if some of them are only small, but that also depends on how you look at them and what you compare them to. Any lessons that you have learned or skills that you have gained, even if they are micro lessons or micro skills, you can apply to other things that are similar or that require similar skills to those you have gained, so they have value.\n\nIt is important to investigate when this type of generalized and polarized thinking arises in regards to a view, especially about oneself (such as those that include 'everything/everyone/nothing/no one' etc.) to see if it is actually the case. If it is not actually the case, even if it has some truth but it is not entirely true, then you should be careful not to get stuck on such a view, as it would be limiting and frankly untrue. Like maybe you did not become an expert in the game, but you at least learnt the controls, the menu, the moves, the map and so on to some extent and got at least some achievements. You should take note of this, as this is valid evidence to counteract the view that you fail at everything.\n\nAlso, you could change the view to something more positive and encouraging, such as if you are not good at something, you could shift that to 'I am in the process of becoming better at this'. Even if it is a long process, you are still in the process as long as there is a chance you might continue.\n\nAnd finally, be careful about who or what you compare yourself and your life to, as if we compare ourselves to others we can often end up just comparing ourselves in a way that makes us feel bad at the time. You have been born in a different set of life conditions than others, so cannot be expected to achieve exactly what others achieve. If you are developing a skill in any part of your life, then you can compare that skill to how it was in the recent and distant past, to see how progress is going regarding it. That is a type of comparison that can be beneficial. Maybe there are times to compare yourself to others, but you should be careful about it and only do it when really needed. Otherwise, when no comparison is needed, experiment with dropping the comparisons and being present to experience in the moment, and notice if there is a sense of fulfillment that comes with doing this.",

    "text": "That's exactly what we're doing, consciously or not, to get back home, to our natural state of Be-ing just to BE, present, happy, at peace. But there are great obstacles on the way due to affliction of intrusive, evasive, anxious thoughts which perturb the mind. Something that was absent when we were young. Now, we feel alienated, separated, lonely, in despair, dissatisfied, it just does not feel right and we know it, at least the ones that are not totally ignorant.\n\n\"Remember when we were young, we shone like the stars now we have this look in our eyes like two black holes in the sky\"-Pink Floyd.\n\nMeditation-mindfulness, in simple terms is none other than awareness already inherent in us and our real nature, a natural state of Being. It is called meditation-mindfulness due to constant disruptive thoughts which meditation-mindfulness supposed to keep off those intrusive thoughts. So, various practices are being prescribed.  If you want to get back nome quicker, consider this.\n\nGet on with your day, live life. But be aware where you are and to see what you're doing at the moment you're doing it, work, play, enjoyment etc. This awareness replaces wandering thoughts for you have no time to attend to them for you're aware where you are and what you're doing at the moment. A guaranteed method for spiritual (inward) awakening of inner energies-intuition. That's the power of awareness.\n\nSince distractive thoughts arise in every moment of life, then awareness must be employed in all of life and not in some exclusive place or time. This includes  any activity, social media too. Notice yourself walking from room to room. Now, stop reading and notice the room you're in. Now, notice yourself in this room that you actually exist. Did you know that while you were absorbed in reading you did not exist to yourself? You were absorbed in reading and not being aware of yourself. Now, you are aware of yourself too, and not only of surroundings.\n\nIndeed, you can do this while typing, reading, doing, cooking dinner and at the same time be aware of your thoughts without judging them, condemning them, arguing with them, but see them as a passing show.\n\nAfter being that aware for some time, you will come upon a great surprise. That you're not those thoughts but that pure witness, pure observer and that will lead you to greater intuition within. Happy trails.",

If for nothing else, I can find gratitude for this process knowing that I don't want to settle as I did that for the first half of my life and was mostly unhappy. \n\nWhat I've learned is that the indecisiveness is a product of emotions I'd rather not feel. In other words when I have a big decision to make and either outcome has potential emotional consequences I flip flop and become indecisive. \n\nMy approach to this issue has been to sit with the discomfort of uncertainty and to allow myself to feel the emotions I'm trying to avoid. Then I set my course when I'm at my best, my happiest and honor that decision when I'm feeling low. Decisions we make tend to bring more of the same emotions that compelled us to make that decision so I tell myself to make decisions from a place of love and not fear. \n\nI'm slowly reaching a point where I can allow my inner knowing, or intuition, to guide me rather than allowing my fickle mind to try to figure it out.\n\nSo hang in there and have patience with yourself.

You operate from a place of setting, communicating, and following through on your boundaries. Where, when, how, and why the relationship takes place, and what it consists of.\n     \nMy family members are all too in denial of their own trauma/mental illness it for me to tolerate being around them much. When I can, however, that's how I'll do it. Impersonally, without being invested in their inner experience.\n       \nFor now, however, it's just too harrowing to witness. It's not like I can explain or teach anything to them. They are uncomfortable with this, and would prefer to be the ones to teach me how to be as happy as they are. Only, I've begrudgingly accepted that they are not happy, and yet true happiness is in fact possible.\n   \nThey benefited from my wishful thinking for a long time. Without the benefit of imagining I might be the one with the issue unable to see how happy and normal they are, I'm left having to accept the proposition of witnessing them in all their dysfunctional suffering. Knowing that they not only aren't on any trajectory to change and be a happy version of themselves, but that as humans they are forces which are actively discouraging others from doing so, either.\n     \nThat's just hard to be around. Realizing the people I wanted to believe would teach me to be vulnerable, in reality talk and behave in ways to avoid being vulnerable, and don't know how to exist as a happy human while being truly vulnerable.\n     \nI believe it's necessary to be fully human. Whether your goal is something good, or something evil, to be fully effective, you have to be able to be truly vulnerable at times to achieve your full potential for anything.\n    \nMy family members all disagree strongly for different reasons. Thus, being around them, there's no way for me to be my true self. Some of them judge with contempt people who talk about a \"true self\" in the first place. Others quietly subtly punish me in various ways for doing so. To be around them would take a great deal of resilience and ability to tolerate discomfort, horror, anguish, and nonsense that I don't have.\n   \nAnd that's on me. I should be able to do that. It's not asking that much. I'm just in really bad shape.",

Others’ negative behaviors don’t necessarily impact me at this point because I’ve done the growth and mindfulness to understand that others’ behaviors have nothing to do with me, but I think when you are just beginning your journey into mindfulness, it can be exceptionally challenging to still be in those negative spaces and not have anyone to talk to or relate to about your own experiences. Worse, to try to engage with them and be met with contention of some sort. \n\nCPTSD is complex post traumatic stress disorder. Typically this involves several traumatic experiences piling up, often without the resources or safety nets to process the traumas. In my case, a pretty significant amount of trauma in childhood and adulthood. This can lead to severe depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and a host of other complex issues. Mindfulness is used to help heal as we attune our thoughts through awareness, honesty, vulnerability. Mindfulness is used in many therapeutic approaches -often an integral part- to treating and hopefully healing CPTSD.",

    "text": "Your last two questions about whether having a goal and planning for your future are inconsistent with the concept of living in the present made me smile because it is “word for word” the same question I struggled (struggle?) with for the longest time.   \n\nThe answer is that it is not inconsistent at all.   The way that the two relate is that you can work toward a goal from a state of presences or present moment awareness.   In fact if a person thinks about it who would really want to achieve their goal or ambition and not have been present to appreciate / enjoy or grow from the beauty and challenges of the journey to get there.   More over, what makes a person think that they would magically appreciate their “life” in a different way once they get there.   Learning to be present and find a spiritual “center” for yourself is really THE point of working toward your life goal or ambition.  \n\nI personally try (with mixed success) to remember that I am only able to take the “next step” toward any goal I have.   I cannot work on the 5th or 6th step from where I am today and so when things appear to happen that cause me stress because they don’t align with an expected future I try to remind myself that I don’t really know the exact path to my goals.  I only know that I can respond to the demands of the present moment which is a much more achievable task than trying to influence a future that I have created in my own mind. \n\nAnyway - it makes sense to me in my own mind though it is much harder to explain (as I have discovered in this post).   I could have stopped my reply to your questions at “not it is not inconsistent - learn to appreciate the present moment as the foundation from where / how your approach your life ambitions.”",

Thoughts are like guests visiting the mind from time to time. They come and go. To overcome thoughts, one has to constantly develop awareness, as this will watch over thoughts so that they hardly arise. Awareness will intercept thoughts. to develop awareness, be aware of the sensation of the breath, the body, or the body movements. Whenever you realize you've lost awareness, simply return to it. do it continuously and awareness will grow stronger and stronger, it will intercept thoughts and make them shorter and fewer. the mind will return to its natural state, which is clean, bright and peaceful. .

Anxiety often thrives on certainty, even if that certainty is in negative habits\n\nInstead of jumping straight into “doing good” or being deeply mindful, maybe the first step is practicing neutrality. Like:\n\n“I notice this breath, even if it’s tight”\n\n“It’s okay that my mind is racing”\n\nNo pressure to change it, just observe. Drop the goal of being better & lean into curiosity\n\nAlso, numbing out with scrolling or music is your body trying to protect you the only way it knows how. What if you honored that, instead of fighting it?\n\nLastly, you’re aware of everything, which is already the start of mindful practices 🙏",

The ego constantly tells us, “This moment isn’t enough. You need more.” So we live in our heads, chasing thoughts, fears, fantasies… anything but what *is*.\n\nThis changes when you no longer indetify with anything, and instead engage all of your attention into the now, feel your body, feel the enviroment, hear the sounds around. Do this every moment, with practice this becomes smoother and effortless. It is as natural as just being\n\nIt’s not that life becomes less boring, it’s that you realize it was never boring to begin with. You just weren’t *there*.\n\nMindfulness reconnects you with *being*. And being is peace. The ego wants and wants. The being *is*. In that space, even washing dishes or sitting in silence can feel more real and fulfilling than the most exciting distractions.\n\nThese are some good sources on mindfullness:\n\n🎥 [The Three Mountains](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCetVV-Qpsq-GiWZVlKndpMQE3AQ34XVc&si=xiwszjN_fuO5KHQC)  \n📖 [List of Gnosis References](https://www.qrcodechimp.com/page/discover-gnosis?v=chk1739628552)",

It only really has a reality in past or future thinking, in the present there is nothing for it to do as you will find alot of activity is muscle memory and habit of mind performing in the present.\n\nSo what's the solution? well, stop using social media as much is one. It only breeds an 'i want' attitude which causes anxiety and feelings of unfulfillment. two; be more present to your actual perceptive experience, not your mind's interpretation of it. Once you manage to do this consitently you will notice subtle changes but it doesn't happen overnight.

I'm more likely now than before mindfulness practice to have a chance to change my reaction to my thoughts, re-consider a compulsive action before I engage, calm my emotional trigger down, etc. \n\nHope that makes sense.

    "text": "Think of it the is way. The anxiety is there waiting and wanting to be expressed. So when you shift your focus to being mindful, it naturally surfaces because it’s been there just under the surface. Distracting and avoiding it is like kicking a can down the road, and building up debt. \n\nFor me, part of what actually helps the anxiety is to allow it. Embrace it. Get curious about it. This felt extremely uncomfortable at first. But paradoxically, this is what also allowed it to start dissipating for me. \n\nMindfulness isn’t just about getting into a better state, but about fully embracing the state you’re currently in with open awareness of it. This means open awareness of the anxiety itself. This awareness has then helped me understand *why* I was anxious and then to reframe the situation or change my behavior, etc. \n\nMy anxiety also got way better once I removed most social media. Reddit is the only exception and even here I’ve been careful to curate my feed to avoid the anxiety-producing subs (most of the big ones these days). I didn’t fully see where this anxiety was coming from until I allowed myself to get curious about it.",

    "text": "Hello, me from 20 years ago. \n\nYou need rest. Big time. You need to put a pause on the rest of your life and rest. Treat this as if you are bleeding out, and the only way to stop it is to slow down and take it easy for a time. You cannot run at 100% operating power 24/7. Your brain will freak the hell out on you if you do. It’s a normal reaction to being overstimulated and overstressed. Your body is trying to tell you something by making you feel like you wanna give it all up and just merely exist. It’s forcing you towards resting whether you like it or not, by mentally checking out of all your hobbies. Instead of fighting this process with your mind, try giving in to it and just RESTING. You don’t need to feel guilty for doing this, either. It is a necessary part of growing, learning that you have to recharge your batteries. \n\nAnd as far as the whole “people have it worse than me I shouldn’t even complain” thing… I’ve gone in and out of depressive episodes since I was 19 years old. I’m 37 now and have stage 4 cancer. It’s debilitating. I can’t get out of bed. I can’t do almost anything outside of a 5x5 square. And you know what? That’s exactly how it is being depressed. Depression is nothing to take lightly. It can turn your entire world upside down. In my very personal opinion I’m not sure which feels worse, depression or cancer. And I’m serious. \n\nSo please, give yourself a break. Be really nice to yourself. Be your number one fan. Listen to your body and don’t fight what it’s trying to point out to you. Be your own advocate. Nobody else is going to do it. It’s all on you. And you can do it. You will do it. You are.",

It doesn’t give me a paycheck but it sure makes feel like i’m alive.\n(Also a personal opinion, i think this lost phase is just another ego trap, go easy on yourself and discipline yourself into kindness gratefulness)",

You need to free yourself of judgment and fear.  \n\nWe can observe emotions without attaching to them.  Our thoughts do not control us.  \n\nI used to have very bad ADHD.  My symptoms have been greatly mitigated by a few years of very intense self work.  I investigated exactly why I was anxious.  When I would get triggered, I would stop and ask myself \"what am I afraid of?\", and the answer would usually come to me quickly.  But you must do this with care and not a voice of criticism.  You need to be very compassionate.\n\nYou got this",

    "text": "\"How do I teach my brain to cut it out?\" — that’s not the solution. Anxiety is the result of underlying fears, usually unconscious ones. When you try to calm down and become more peaceful, those fears start knocking harder — or rather, their stressed effects become more noticeable. When the mind is no longer distracted, it becomes easier to feel what’s truly there.\nThe real solution is to map out the fears that prevent you from being at peace with reality. This may require the help of an experienced guide — someone who knows how to navigate the subconscious through meditation therapy.\nIf the core belief behind the fear is uncovered, it can be changed through new insights. Once that happens, the fear loses its threatening power. As a result, the stress dissolves — and so does the symptom.\n(I speak from experience.)",

We were poor, little food and my father used to steal the money for food and buy Large amounts of hard liquor, both parents were heavy smokers. Of course my father ate that food as quickly as possible. to get my working papers at 15 and started buying food for myself and my siblings. I had to hide my cash so my parents could not get to it .I Remember getting a scholarship to become a nurse and loved my career. I married a good man and we raised three children.\nI still have flashbacks to those days and happy that my 6 siblings are doing well. I'm a senior citizen now and am mentally prepared for the possibility that I may die first, but I am ready for that, as my husband and I are born again Christians.",

Even if someone is \"wrong\", what does it really matter? Why give yourself the impossible job of the arbiter of absolute truth in the universe when you're unqualified?\n\nOftentimes, your inability to deal with others' thoughts and feelings is a projection of your own insecurity. I'd recommend looking there first and trying to soften often. What does it mean if you're wrong, like really what does it mean? Generally it doesn't mean anything... But it FEELS like it means something, but you aren't your feelings. The sooner you can realize this and practice mindfulness with this in mind the easier life will be and the better your relationships will be for you.\n\nTry to approach everything with equanimity, this takes patience for yourself and others. Truth is generally relative, there is no absolutely right or wrong, so approaching things with a \"maybe\" mindset is the easiest way to go about life. Why make things harder than they need to be, what's your goal? Don't soften your position, soften your effort. If you're young then understand this becomes easier with time and practice. Congratulations for understanding you may be hurting yourself and others, and wanting to do better, that creates a lot of space for your growth. Good luck!",

    "text": "I feel like a lot of people have a misconception about \"non-judgement\". The idea isn't that you should get rid of all judgements. You're a human, you will always have judgements that naturally arise. The point of meditation is to NOTICE how quick your mind is to judge. To notice how quick it is to judge your judgements even! And then to compassionately return to the meditation object. Non-judgement doesn't mean aim to have 0 judgements, but to not allow yourself to get caught up in them, or to attach yourself to them once you do notice. \n\nImagine your mind is a puppy. You wouldn't get mad at a puppy for being a puppy. If it does something \"bad\", scolding it will usually make it more volatile. Providing a comforting a loving environment will allow the puppy to calm down all on its own. You can't force the puppy to do anything. You can only cultivate the environment of stillness and compassion.",

Many a wise person has said that it wasn’t the person who “spit on you” but rather the anger within you that got you all revved up. \n\nIt might also help to remember the person who spit on you was probably in a bad place within, and it’s quite obvious they they let their anger get the better of them in a way that could be considered pretty hostile and horrible. We might also be able to assume that you wouldn’t choose to do this to someone else in anger, but only you can truly answer that. Realizing someone else’s anger brought them to that action, might hopefully be enough for you to see you don’t like the idea of matching their energy or their anger. \n\nTake more time to be aware of when your anger rises and if possible try to insert a pause before the embers within turn to flame. It’ll take practice but if you keep tabs on your own shit, without letting it get the better of you you’re likely to begin to see that if you truly want to be different- you can be different. \n\nBest to you.",

    "text": "The answer to your question is;  Forgiveness.  \n\n\nIf you can, forgive them, forgive everyone who has ever hurt you and forgive yourself for anything and everything. \n\n\nForgiving others is a gift you are ultimately giving to yourself.  The person you are angry at, can't feel your anger right now, but you can.  So why should you feel bad?  \n\n\nTheir action is no longer the cause of your suffering because it's over now and they are gone.  Your thoughts and memory of the event is the only thing that is harming you in this moment.  Letting that go frees yourself from further suffering.  \n\n\nI was bullied all my life so I truly feel for you.  But right now you are carrying their pain and it's not yours to carry, its theirs.  If you refuse to carry it for them, it will ricochet straight back to their energy field, instead of yours.\n\n\nLet it go, not with resentment, but with understanding.  Surely they are deeply hurt inside to have done that (truly, truly suffering and in intense pain).  And if someone is truly suffering, they need empathy, love, understanding and care.\n\n\nIt's not about taking the high road, it's about understanding that everyone is going through their own traumas and we can't always see that.  Maybe that person just lost a child, we don't know.  Maybe they are becoming homeless today due to unfair dismissal and losing their income?  That is not an excuse, but it is a potential reason.    So, since we dont know why and never will, we can choose empathy or anger.  \n\n\nWhen we react, we aren't actually in control of ourselves.  When we respond, we are.  When we are angry, it can be very difficult to respond.  But there is real power in pausing to prevent a reaction, instead of a response. \n\n\nYou witnessed a reaction today, instead of a response and wasn't it terrible?  Now if that driver could have responded, instead of reacting, you would have had a very different encounter with them. \n\n\nThey might not have had the mental capacity to behave better in that moment.  That's very sad.  Maybe you can wish for them to be healed of whatever it is that is hurting them so deeply?\n\n\nEmpathy and forgiveness will always be stronger than judgement, hate and violence and you could choose to look at this experience as a genuine way to grow who you are and how you want to be in the world.  If you can learn forgiveness in the heat of this moment, then you have grown exponentially.  And that is major!   That's something every human should aim for, because it is not easy.  \n\n\nWe can't change others, but we can change ourselves and every one of us that chooses to aim higher,  regardless of the situation, helps to make the world a better and safer place for everyone.  \n\n\nI am not excusing their behaviour, but I am giving you the opportunity of seeing that the moment is over and if you choose to forgive, then you'll instantly feel better and you'll sleep well because you won't be reliving it in your thoughts and feelings.  That makes you triumphant in this unfortunate situation. \n\n\nSo if you want to feel better, forgive.  If you don't want to feel better, don't forgive.   \n\n\nIt's a choice.  But the only one who'll feel better is you.  And you absolutely deserve to feel better.  \n\n\nVirtual hug to you and it's terrible that you had to experience that.  But it's over now and you can choose to sleep well tonight.  \n\n\nConsider also, that they also have an opportunity to reflect on their behaviour when they go to sleep tonight.  With good fortune, maybe they'll see that their behaviour needs to change, regardless of their personal situation and if that happens, that means both you and they have turned a terrible situation into a mutual learning opportunity.  That's important and could potentially happen.  \n\n\nI hope you sleep peacefully and deeply tonight.  💕  And I hope that they reflect on their behaviour and how their behaviour has affected you and how they can improve there feelings, thoughts and actions.",

It’s for your wellbeing and mental health. This guy is certainly an asshole and may not deserve your loving kindness. But you definitely deserve to be free from this suffering. Because you obviously have the intention to let this go.\n\nSometimes it feels forced and that’s okay.

    "text": "Let me make up a story to show why you should forgive. Not how, but why. \n\n\n\nA week before the man spat at you, his mother died.\n\nHe was at work when he got the call: Come quickly. It's serious. But it was too late, by the time he got there, she had already passed. He was the only staff on that night because a colleague had called in sick, and he couldn't leave until cover arrived.\n\nThe replacement staff couldn’t find their keys. They’d been woken up at 3 a.m. and were scrambling. On the way in, they hit every red light, then ran into a diversion that delayed them another 20 minutes.\n\nAll the while, the man sat there, torn apart with worry, thinking, “They should’ve been here 40 minutes ago. God damn it.” His frustration boiled over. He finally sped off to the hospital the moment cover arrived, but his mother had passed just minutes before he got there.\n\nHe blamed himself. He blamed the staff. He blamed the world.\n\nThe grief didn’t come out as tears. It came out as rage.\n\nSo a week later, when he spat at you, he wasn’t seeing you. He was seeing every locked door, every red light, every missed moment with the only person who ever made him feel safe.\n\n\nForgiveness doesn’t mean justifying the action.\nIt means letting go of the need to carry someone else's suffering as your own.\n\nWhen you understand that pain often passes itself on, you get to be the one who stops the cycle.\n\nPeople have been through things you can't even imagine. Be gracious and understanding.",

Do a task, maybe give yourself the 25 minutes if you can manage it, and then take 5 minutes and sit there doing nothing but listening to your breathing. Do a box breathing technique and focus on the rise and fall of your chest, the air entering your nose, and going out through your mouth. Your brain will be on the high of working and doing something stressful (meaning it it was active but felt the stress of getting it done), and the breathing forces you to keep that going, but in a way that is helpful for your sympathetic nervous system. As you get used to doing this, pick a day off and extend it to 10 minutes, then 15, and so on. \n\nAnother trick is to do something that is not productive towards a goal. Just one thing a week though to prevent it becoming a habit. Go for a drive when you are supposed to work on a project for yourself. This is for the extreme days when you are really hopping. \n\nThere are other things, but hopefully this helps.",

    "text": "This is the thread that I would pull at.   I am with you in your GAD experience.   Allowing for and accepting that you are going to be anxious, coupled with breathing techniques and allowing yourself to BE anxious is a somewhat counter intuitive starting point.   Not that hobbies are a bad thing at all but when you are engaging in them as a way of avoiding or combating your anxiety you are signalling your Brian that there is a threat that you are avoiding and inadvertently reinforcing a nervous system that is out of balance and stuck in fight or flight.    There is a “do it anyway” principle that encourages people that suffer with specificity triggered anxiety to try do the triggering activity anyway even in the face of anxiety as a way of breaking the loop that I described.   This can be harder with GAD in my experience because it lacks any recognizable trigger but the principle is the same that you are “ok” - (call it safe maybe) even when you are sitting still and doing nothing.   So the “do it” in this case is to just sit and not need to be actively engage in a hobby from time to time.  Breathing techniques can be a help as I have noted as can mindfulness (though that is not for everyone so don’t feel it is a “must” if the experience is too intense for you initially).  \n\nI have recommended and will continue to recommend an author / speaker / councillor and former anxiety sufferer who goes by Anxiety Josh and hosts a podcast called disordered.   If nothing else it is a collection of Q/A sessions with others who have similar life challenges - I suspect that it will be an excellent source of reassurance and likely guidance.",

I've been finding some really helpful guided meditations lately –  I actually just stumbled across this cool channel/blog (you can see @medium motivorrnofficial and our @YouTube motivorrn if you're interested), they have some great tips on focusing on the present moment.  Have you tried focusing on your senses – like really noticing the feeling of your feet on the floor?  That can sometimes help break the thought loop. What techniques have you tried so far?",

    "text": "You seem to know this side of yourself very well, which is why what I’m saying will likely help you. The more you are aware of what you don’t like about this anger is your guide to looking for better. If this anger is on a hair trigger, I understand how it feels hard and maybe even hopeless to remove from you, but that is incorrect. If you want something different for yourself ONLY you can create it. I mentioned inserting a pause before you react, and I know how hard that is, but it’s going to be on you as to how you go about that. \n\nIt likely won’t happen the first time you attempt it, but if you can realize you missed your chance and react in anger, that is not failure- it’s simply part of your practice. Very few if any of us can be good at something on the first try. It takes time and finesse to keep noticing how we can be better, how we might have gone about it differently. \n\nYou’ve said you have held this now unwanted trait with anger for some time, so imagine you’ve created a rut for yourself because you’ve done it so many times before. That rut gets deeper depending on how long we’ve been doing something. It works for us in both positive and negative ways, but it is possible to alter that rut- or even better dig yourself out of it. It will take effort and work on your part, but I promise you a better way lies ahead- if only you keep trying to be better. \n\nI not only understand how hard this is, I too know it because I used to live with past anger lying in the wait, just looking for something to pounce on. I can happily say today, that has truly left me. For me it was taking a deep breath right as someone “triggered” me. Yes, it took me quite a while to get to where I am today, but it finally began to stick when I no longer could live with myself for letting anger run my show and I put the majority of my energy to changing. It is possible. \n\nI will add that being and remaining aware of your inner anger (likely from our pasts) will be key in this process because if we don’t also search for the root cause of it, we may never be able to truly let it go. Doing so will also create some tangible aspects to help you understand your anger. \n\nOnce again, best to you.",

As it’s vital to note that your brain and its programs , not YOU , are the source of all anxiety. The brain and ego live in distortions and stories only , the brain can’t be present , only dwelling in made up perspectives of the past and imaginary futures that will never arrive . The brain/ego exist only in a state of conflict and there is no possible way to ever satisfy it , the cravings only get worse … learn to meditate so you can separate from identifying with the brain and its programs of lack/scarcity , doubt , fear , unworthiness, boredom etc etc… as loneliness is quite a natural response to our reality ,as we every much were born and will die alone , but boredom /anxiety are a result of sitting with the real enemy , and that enemy is within , not in the external world .. get outdoors as much as possible , walk barefoot , get sunshine , listen to heart centered music , exercise , eat live foods , practice generosity or charity to others . As thinking about the self to a point of obsession is the anxiety , and thinking about others and deploying genuine compassion always beings us into alignment and starts to cultivate a lasting sense of peace and satisfaction .. but only “ you “ can be ever be satisfied or at ease , if you identify as the brain or the thinker of thoughts , the anxiety will never pass for very long .",
